====== Undead ======
An undead creature formed of an incomplete [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|primordial vessel]], unfit to imprison any [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]], and some additional construct of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Mana]] which, by the rules of the [[creation:creation]] within which it exists, allows it to do so anyway. This construction of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Mana]] is often, but not always, a type of [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]], or the imprisoned soul itself may be a [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] - which is somewhat easier to achieve in most [[creation:creation]]s.

The [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] mechanics in [[creation:Marlien]] which allow for construction of [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]]s and imprisonment of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] in unsuitable [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|primordial vessel]]s are typically composed of [[creation:Marlien:energy#negative_energy]].

===== Alignment and Sentience =====
Undead created with a [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] as the core are not typically evil, but they operate only by command, or very base instincts. Some are capable of sustaining themselves without drawing mana from, or otherwise harming others. Those which seek destruction, ruin, bloodshed and suffering do so only by the command of another. The same can largely be said for those where a [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] is attached to a real [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]]; while the [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] inevitably restrains sentience of the creature and may be used to manipulate its behaviour, it need not be explicitly evil, and will likely appear vastly more intelligent than one driven purely by a [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]].

An undead creature with a bound [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] unrestrained by any [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] freely obeys the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] and abides by its alignment.


===== Murmurings =====
Corporeal and incorporeal undead are prone to displaying semblances of intelligence, and even [[creation:true_creation:memory|memories]] of the corporeal form, or of an imprisoned [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. While this is most common and pronounced amongst undead bearing a real [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], it also occurs in the simplest undead, which are just a [[creation:true_creation:faux_soul]] bound to a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|vessel]] which, at least in part, once held a real [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. In the latter case, this is possible because the precise memories of a living creature are recorded in the essence of the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|vessel]], not in the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]; the simplest of such memories are not so obfuscated as be completely beyond recovery without the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], and so the undead creature may manifest habits of the intelligence which once occupied its [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|vessel]]. Such habits are typically short, strained utterances, particular movements or attachments to objects and places, or apparent reaction to familiar names or objects.
