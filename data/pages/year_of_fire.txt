====== Year of Fire ======
The Year of Fire marked the beginning of the [[:Naltera]] [[:Naltera:Ice Age]], announced by the eruption of [[:Zwo Kayan]]. Legends say that when the enormous [[:Zwo Kayan]] erupted, all other [[volcano]]s in [[:Marlien]] erupted with it, and the world was all aglow with fire. Certainly there is evidence that other [[:volcano]]s upon [[:Naltera]] errupted around the same time.

===== Other Portents =====
  * In [[:Agyanist]] legend, the [[:Zwo Kayan:dragon]] also named [[:Zwo Kayan]] was also especially active during the Year of Fire.
  * Many cultures note an increased potency and commonality of fire-based [[:creation:magic]] at this point in history.
