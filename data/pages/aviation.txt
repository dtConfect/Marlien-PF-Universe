In many cases inter-[[:spire]] travel requires that a vehicle moves between two or more dominant gravitational fields, such as that of a [[:spire]] and that of [[creation:Marlien]]'s main terrain. In such situations, it is important to properly orientate the vehicle to avoid capsizing, or other sudden movements and unstable behaviors.

In the most straightforward case, where the vehicle is moving out of the atmosphere of a [[:spire]], and into the atmosphere of [[creation:Marlien]]'s terrain, the vehicle should ideally be facing northward, moving northward and upward, and the aft of the vehicle weighed below the bow; this should keep the vehicle in an upright orientation and maintain velocity.

In the reverse case, the vehicle should be facing the [[:spire]], moving toward the [[:spire]], and the aft of the vehicle again weighed below the bow; this should keep the vehicle in an upright orientation and maintain velocity.
