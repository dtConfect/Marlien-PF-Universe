====== Xiexio ======
Xiexio (she-shö) is the abbreviated name of the Xienonxionin (She-non-shö-nin), also named Xeno or Zeno by the phonetic translation of their hieroglyphs by some scholars on the [[:spire]] [[:Naltera]].

The Xienonxionin are a race of technologically advanced, four-armed humanoids native to [[:Thexingja]].

===== Telekinesis =====
Whether by natural evolution, the product of genetic manipulation, or a deliberate mutation influenced by some outsider, Xienonxionin and some other creatures native to [[:Thexignja]] posses the innate ability to manipulate certain materials by telekinesis.

Many of their smaller vehicles are designed using sufficient quantities of such materials to allow complex rearrangements of their modules, and hands-free navigation. While it is also possible to build interfaces which take advantage of this ability, some Xienonxionin prefer to interact with technology through projected, haptic interfaces, and these are provided as an emergency backup for most technology in case some circumstance interferes with the use of telekinesis.
