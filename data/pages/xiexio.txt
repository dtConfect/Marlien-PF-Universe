====== Xiexio ======
Xiexio (she-shö) is the abbreviated name of the Xienonxionin (She-non-shö-nin), also named Xeno or Zeno by the phonetic translation of their hieroglyphs by some scholars on the [[:spire]] [[:Naltera]].

The Xienonxionin are a race of technologically advanced, four-armed humanoids uniquely native to [[:Thexingja]].

===== Telekinesis =====
Whether by natural evolution, the product of genetic manipulation, or a deliberate mutation influenced by some outsider, Xienonxionin and some other creatures native to [[:Thexingja]] posses the innate ability to manipulate certain materials by telekinesis.

Many of their smaller vehicles are designed using sufficient quantities of such materials to allow complex rearrangements of their modules, and hands-free navigation. While it is also possible to build interfaces which take advantage of this ability, some Xienonxionin prefer to interact with technology through projected, haptic interfaces, and these are provided as an emergency backup for most technology in case some circumstance interferes with the use of telekinesis.

===== Appearance =====
Xienonxionin are of roughly human stature and build, tending to be shorter on average, and slight or athletic rather than muscular - though the range is as extreme as it may be among humans. The first pair of arms is located where a human's would be, where the second extend from an additional pair of shoulders just below and behind the first. They have a deep, somewhat dull pink or purple complexion, ranging through to pale blue tones in some regions of [[:Thexingja]]. Their hair, typically adorned with beads made from a kinesis-reactive material, is most naturally a purple or blue colour darker than the skin, fading to a silver-gray with age; lighter shades of blue, even almost white, are also found naturally, and teal hair is a somewhat rare occurrence.

Facially, Xienonxionin vary from region to region, but to a human of [[:Naltera]], the notable differences in face shape are a tendency towards narrow noses, large lips, and lobeless ears which are sometimes pointed, and sometimes like small circles. Furthermore, where a human would have eyebrows a Xienonxionin appears to have a row of spherical stones set into the brow; though hard and solid these are actually formed from the same material as the hair, and so share its colour. The number of these stones varies from person to person, but is usually between 3 and 5, with the stones nearer to the centre being on average the largest.

In most Xienonxionin cultures, individuals of high standing wear loose-fitting robes with no specific sleeves cut, and paint their faces with heavy make-up in traditional styles. Robes and other garments, as with hair, are often set with kinesis-reactive beads.
