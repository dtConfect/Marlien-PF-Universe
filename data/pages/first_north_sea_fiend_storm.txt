====== First North Sea Fiend Storm ======
The First North Sea Fiend Storm was the first major [[:Fiend Storm]] in the recorded history of [[:Paraesi]]. It was caused, and possibly also terminated, by the works of [[:Vinewyltt]].

===== Impact =====
The storm was responsible for the immediate decimation of the surrounding [[:Uubvine]], [[:Warelin]], and [[:Emerowydthwaeth]] peoples, including the lone [[:Emerowydthwaeth]] city [[:Emero Wydth]]. The fallout of the storm corrupted surrounding creatures, including many of the [[:Vinewyltt]]'s [[:Chimera]]s, and rendered the mountains incredibly hazardous for centuries to come.
