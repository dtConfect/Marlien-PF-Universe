====== First North Sea Fiend Storm ======
The First North Sea Fiend Storm was the first major [[:Fiend Storm]] in the recorded history of [[:Paraesi]]. It was caused, and possibly also terminated, by the works of [[:Vinewyltt]].

===== Impact =====
The storm was responsible for the immediate decimation of the surrounding [[:Uubvine]], [[:Warelin]], and [[:Emerowydthwaeth]] peoples, including the lone [[:Emerowydthwaeth]] city [[:Emero Wydth]]. The fallout of the storm corrupted surrounding creatures, including many of the [[:Vinewyltt]]'s [[:Chimera]]s, and rendered the mountains incredibly hazardous for centuries to come.

For the duration of the event the majority of [[:Uubvine]] was unscathed, though the eye of the storm did not extend so far as the citadel's outermost walls on any side other than that from which [[:Vinewyltt]]'s [[:Vinewyltt's Keep]] overlooked the valley. The people trapped within were coralled to the very top and centre, at the foot of [[:Vinewyltt's Keep]], whereafter the eldritch creatures and powers emerging from the outskirts closed in ever tighter, and many of the [[:Uubvine]] people were slain, or worse.

At the termination of the storm, when [[:Vinewyltt]] emerged from the valley after [[:Vinewyltt#transformation]], the survivors of the catastrophe were freed to flee the citadel, [[:Vinewyltt]] having slain a number of the most prominent creatures threatening his people before ascending to the eye. Still, few of the [[:Uubvine]] people were able to escape alive, and fewer still made it through the outside desolation to met up with the fleeing [[:Warelin]] people.
