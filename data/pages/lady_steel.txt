====== Annadrere ======
The Lady Steel, Annadrere, is a [[:Kyton#fleshbound|Fleshbound Kyton]] operating in close proximity to [[prince_of_pain]].

Her host body is that of an intensely dedicated desciple; a twisted young woman not fourteen years old, who is unique in that her consiousness is allowed to reign over her mutilated body not only once in a blue moon, which would be unusual for a [[:Kyton#fleshbound|Fleshbound Kyton]], but at all times except for when she is in the thick of combat. The grevious, reticent manner of the [[:Kyton]] mind is a stark contrast to the human host's childish, playful (though sadistic) behaviour.

Annadrere's body is that of a youn girl, perhaps fourteen, svelte, with a soft, expressive face. From the top of her crown, the backs of her arms, down her spine, and beneath her ribs, her flesh has been peeled away from the bone, so that thick plates of charred steel may be afixed. The skin has then been elegantly laced back and forth like a corset, pulling the features of her face roughly back into place, though the metal dome about her skull is clearly visible, even through the corsetted slit down to the tip of her nose.
