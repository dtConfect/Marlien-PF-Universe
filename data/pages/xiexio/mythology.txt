===== Charis =====
The [[:Charis]] founder [[:Hera]] is named in [[:xiexio]] mythology as //Lonwendo// - a somewhat tragic figure who had to banish her lover //Kuenhai// ([[:pasithea]]) in order to protect the mortal realm from his destructive fits of passion. The story is one of a few which has a significant cultural impact in the discouragement of arcane meddling.

In this tradition, Lonwendo and Kuenhai were lovers, which may or may not be true of the real figures [[:Hera]] and [[:Pasithea]].

Kuenhai, however, gradually became obsessed with his own ideals, becoming withdrawn from the affairs of mortals, and instead meddling and reforming distant [[:planes:planes]] or places on a whim. When eventually he had become too absorbed in his endeavours, he strayed too near to the borders or mortal reality, and became a dangerous force, corrupting and destructive towards the [[:Xiexio]]. Utlimately, he could not be dissuaded from his course, and Lonwendo had to banish him to a distant [[:planes:planes|plane]].
