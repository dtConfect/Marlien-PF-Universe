The [[:Charis]] founder [[:Hera]] is named in xiexio mythology as //Lonwendo// - a somewhat tragic figure who had to banish her lover //Kuenhai// ([[:pasithea]]) in order to protect the mortal realm from his destructive fits of passion. The story is one of a few which has a significant cultural impact in the discouragement of arcane meddling.
