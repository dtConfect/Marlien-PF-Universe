====== Xiexio Mythology ======
===== Charis =====
The [[:Charis]] founder [[:Hera]] is named in [[:xiexio]] mythology as //Lonwendo// - a somewhat tragic figure who had to banish her lover //Kuenhai// ([[:pasithea]]) in order to protect the mortal realm from his destructive fits of passion. The story is one of a few which has a significant cultural impact in the discouragement of arcane meddling.

In this tradition, Lonwendo and Kuenhai were lovers, which may or may not be true of the real figures [[:Hera]] and [[:Pasithea]]. They were a pair of beautiful, divine figures who watched over mortals from the heavens, sometimes providing aid or advice. Kuenhai, however, gradually became obsessed with his own ideals, becoming withdrawn from the affairs of mortals, and instead meddling and reforming distant [[:planes:planes]] or places on a whim. When eventually he had become too absorbed in his endeavours, he strayed too near to the borders or mortal reality, and became a dangerous force, corrupting and destructive towards the [[:Xiexio]]. Utlimately, he could not be dissuaded from his course, and Lonwendo had to banish him to a distant [[:planes:planes|plane]].

===== Charon =====
Some of the more obscure records of Xienonxionin mythology mention a council of Grey Gods, which may or may not refer to the [[:creation:true_creation:charon]]. The Grey Gods are said to be dispassionate and to scarcely involve themselves in mortal affairs, though their judgement is immediate and final once moved to action.
