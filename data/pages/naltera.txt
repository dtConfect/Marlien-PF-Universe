====== Naltera ======
Naltera is a [[:spire]] of [[creation:Marlien]]. It has a mountainous, curved base connecting to the floor of [[creation:Marlien]] upon a plateau beside the [[volcano#Solar Volcano]] [[Kri-yen]], the two being surrounded by the [[Circle Sea]].

===== Moons =====
Naltera has one [[moon]] in its orbit: [[Lufia]], home of the [[Svailorn]].


===== Stars =====
Naltera has one [[star]] in its orbit: [[Biora]], born of [[Kri-yen]].

Nearing the end of its 20,000 year cycle the sun reddens and shrinks, allowing Naltera to cool. A surge of activity in the magma beneath Naltera's crust causes many of the spire's smaller [[volcanoes|volcano]] to spill over constantly while a new [[star]] is formed beneath [[Kri-yen]]. During this time the spire enters a long ice age lit by the red glow of the dying sun and [[volcanoes|volcano]].

When the new [[star]] emerges from [[Kri-yen]] it meets its predecessor in orbit, where the two fuse together.
