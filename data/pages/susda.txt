====== Susuda ======
The Republic of Susuda is a long-lived democratic state founded around 700 [[:calendar|BC]] by the peaceful union of the old Susudan kingdoms, whose territories stretched from the easternmost tip of [[:paraesi]], where it meets [[:Angdyne]], far westward, south of [[::arthalean empire]], and holding a large part of the [[:serpent sea]]'s north-eastern shoreline.

Though the reign of kings in Susuda has long since passed, the Susudan provinces are still named for the royal houses, and the blood of such houses still makes up a significant portion of the upper classes at [[:year_zero]]. Those in the republic from noble houses are still referred to as princes and princesses, but they are numerous, and the title is so coveted by others that it can be difficult to verify an individual's right to it. It has, however, come to carry with it an implication of charitability and altruism, which is very much the outward character of Susuda's upper classes, and commoners feel free to revoke it when dealing with supposed nobles whom they feel are unworthy.

Susuda is famous for it's ancient tradition of state-subsidised colleges, which receive a regular stipend to support the recruitment of talent from those social classes which may otherwise not be able to pursue a scholarly or scientific career. Such recruits often dwell in dormitories in or near colleges, rather than remaining with their families as others might.

The colleges follow the general theme of Susudan culture, which is the application of scholarly methodology to all things, including science, arcana, government, and diplomacy. This culture, along with the comparatively small role that religion plays in Susudan culture, is what allowed the republic, and the kings before it, to exist peacefully alongside the power of [[:arthalean_empire]].
