====== The Fire Plane ====== 
The Fire Plane is the home of [[:Tingma]], created by herself to seal her destructive power away from the other [[planes]]. Being a schism of [[planes:Material]], it is not entirely composed of fire, though the number of other substances which can retain a solid or even liquid state near to the intense heat of [[:Tingma]] is few, and many of the inhabitants, which include fire elementals, are composed at least in part of living fire or magma.

The terrain is composed of splintered rock and magma flows, falling away from a central peak where the throne of [[:Tingma]] sits.
