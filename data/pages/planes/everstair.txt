====== The Everstair ======
The Everstair is a plane carved out of the creation [[creation:Marlien]] by the [[creation:true_creation:Charon#Charon Immortals]]. It is entirerly encircled by the [[planes:Halls of the Charon]], which is the only plane directly accessible from it by planar travel. It serves as a safehouse for mortal [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman|souls]] between incarnations, which would otherwise be subject to the appetites of all manner of things.

===== Nature =====
In actuality, the Everstair is a highly esoteric plane formed from raw [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] devoid of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], constantly shaped by the minds of [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|immortal]] attendants.

Because of this, the Everstair is capable of appearing to be an infinite, physical space consistently rising, and somehow denying residents the ability to retrace their steps for any significant distance. An inumerable number of souls may be resident here at any one moment, and may cross paths spontaneously.

===== Adversity =====
At times, certain adversarial artefacts have been known to manifest within the Everstair. This usually presents as some simple, short-lived encounter with a wild creature, a deep chasm which must be crossed, or a particularly hostile climate. However, more significant artefacts are not unknown - sometimes involving shadowy fortresses or cavernous ascents.

There are a number of possible explanations for such adversity: the attending [[creation:true_creation:Charon#charon]] may be testing the souls who wander here; the shaping of the forest may be a cooperative effort between the attendants and the mortal souls themselves; or the adversity may stem from a seed of corruption sown somewhere within the Everstair, known as the [[planes:Everdark]].

===== Topography =====
Typically, the Everstair is a quiet realm of cold, misted forest, and widely-spaced stone steps or ledges, broken and worn, seeming always to ascend gradually towards the cresent moon. Tattered seals dress the treet, decorated with beads and coloured string, written upon in strange symbols. Songbirds, ravens, and crows watch silently from the tree-branches, and invisible presences wind between the the trunks. Ocassionally a twig is heard snapping, or a stream flowing.

In the distance behind branches seem to close on the road travelled, and upon returning to the lowest visible point it is revealed to be merely the floor of a narrow valley, sometimes with a bridge over a brook, or a stream narrow enough to step over, but always with another hill ascending on the other side.

Somewhere in the Cold Forest there are rumoured to be two rivers: one flowing slowly uphill, and the other flowing swiftly downward; the latter, it is whispered, may lead back to the realms of the living, though it is quite perilous.
