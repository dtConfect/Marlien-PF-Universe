====== The Astral Plane ======
The Astral Plane is base form of the [[planes:planes#immaterium]], the invisible neighbour of the [[planes:planes#materium]]. It appears as a vast void, populated only by strange nebulae, eldritch creatures, and pockets of activity centred around areas which are populous in the [[planes:planes#materium]], such as [[:spire]]s, [[:planet]]s, and [[:spacecraft]]. The [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] which gather around such places are often varying magnitudes of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]], who wait with mouths open and claws readied to grasp at any  [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] newly freed from its mortal shell. Such creatures dip periodically into [[planes:Ethereal]], where they can see into [[planes:Material]], and sense new death over great distances.
