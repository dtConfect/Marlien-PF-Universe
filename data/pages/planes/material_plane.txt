====== The Material Plane ======
The Material Plane is a [[planes:planes|plane]] of the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]]. It consists of a vast, mountainous terrain including inumerable [[:spire|spires]], around which orbit [[:moon|moons]] and [[:star|stars]]. On spears with stars, or spears and regions of the plane near to stars, Marlien provides a climate sufficient to sustain traditional biological life.

===== Topography =====
The exact topography of the Material Plane is not understood. It is not observed locally to be curved, nor have any [[:spire|spires]] been discovered from which extend additional [[:spire|spires]] or other structures, yet the arangement of [[:star|stars]] in the skies, which appear randomly distributed and at differing distances, defies the idea that the plane is roughly flat. It has been theorised on some [[:spire|spires]] that Marlien is, in fact, composed of one or more inverse sphears, or a more complex cavernous structure, possibly with some dense, transparent substance, or crystaline layers which distort observations of distant [[:star|stars]]. It is also possible that Marlien's space is folded into some non-euclidean form, which allows it to serve as both flat, and in some complex form - perhaps fractal.

The terrain of the plane is locally observed to be flat, or occupied by mountain ranges whose average height never varies significantly, with occasional [[:spire|spires]] of great height extending from it. Gravity on the plane pulls towards it, varying greatly in strength from region to region, except where there ar large enough [[:spire|spires]] or mountains to posess their own gravity. There, the strength of gravity appears to bear no relation to the size of the [[:spire]], and does not differ significantly from the base to the tip. Excavations of the plane have never revealed it to be anything but solid, to any depth.
