====== Nod ======
Nod is a [[planes:planes|plane]] of the [[creation:marlien|creation Marlien]], wherein no conscious being may persist in a waking state, even if it ordinarily would not, or could not sleep. It has historically been used as a sort of low-security prison for certain undesirable entities, including the [[:Wild Charis]] founder [[:Pasithea]].

Willful beings, however, are able to communicate across planes even while sleeping, so as to direct their minions, and even some quantity of their ordinary power, so Nod is not an ideally prison for powerful malign entities, or those with powerful allies ho may act to free them.

Being a part of the [[planes:planes#immaterium]], Nod has little notable physical presence besides a smattering of  grey matter ([[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]]), which typically assumes insignificant forms dictated by the dreams of nearby residents. Visits to Nod more commonly take the form of visits to such dreamscapes.

It is important to note that Nod does not protect its residents from the passage of time, and mortals here will eventually die and decay if they are not nourished or rescued.
