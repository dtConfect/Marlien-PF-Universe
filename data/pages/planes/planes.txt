==== List of Planes of Marlien ====
Planes in the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]] are divided into the [[#Materium]] and [[#Immaterium]]. While [[Solitude]] is the base form of the [[#Materium]], which is filled with both [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]], [[Astral]] is the base form of the [[#Immaterium]], which is primarily filled with [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], appearing as void populated by nebulae and other strange forms.

The [[#Materium]] and [[#Immaterium]] overlap, and are separated by [[Ethereal]].
