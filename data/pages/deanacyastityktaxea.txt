====== Deanacyastityktaxea ======
Deanacyastityktaxea (also __Deana__ or __Blackbird__) is a female [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|creature]] in the [[creation:creation]] of [[creation:Marlien]] which is a [[:half-breed]] of [[:succubus]] and [[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#memitim]].

She is a favoured [[wp>Fourth_wall]]-breaking and world-breaking tool of the writer, frequently referencing things from [[creation:Totum]] or [[creation:Totum|the real world]] despite no in-universe explanation for why she might be able to travel between [[creation:creation|creations]]. She also makes direct appearances before mortals on [[planes:Material]] of [[creation:Marlien]] and otherwise flouts the the laws of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] to an extent, making excuses that due to her imperfect heritage she finds it difficult to properly transpose herself to the right time or location. As a result, she is at the centre of [[planes:Material|Material Plane]] legends of the [[blackbird|Blackbird]] which began with the reckless exploits of her [[creation:true_creation:charon#memitim]] mother, [[:mikaotrexeaonoa]].

===== History =====
==== Birth ====
Deana is the daughter of the famed [[creation:true_creation:charon#Memitim]] [[:Mikaotrexeaonoa]] and an unknown [[:succubus]].

==== Significant Interactions ====
=== Lucias ===
Deana was briefly acquainted with the [[:sapient_skeleton]] [[summoner]] [[:pcs:Lucias]], whom she met in the forests of central [[:Angdyne]] when tracking the location of the [[:angdyne:desolation]] at the site of the [[:crux]] penetration. She initially attacked him, owing to a hatred of the necromancers, the undead, and their kin, but was deterred when her mother's scythe, [[#Ayao]] failed to harm him - though it easily destroyed his [[:celestial_titan#celestial_eidolons|Celestial Eidolon]] companion [[:pcs:Angelo]], which had only a [[:creation:true_creation:faux_soul]].

Later Deana visited Lucias as he slept in a barn at [[:Angdyne:Woodsfarm]] to inform him that she was to be his collector upon his demise, but first, through spying on his dreams, learned of the [[:charis#dea|Charis Dea]] [[:Antheraea]]'s interest in him.
