====== Deanacyastityktaxea ======
Deanacyastityktaxea is a female [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|creature]] in the [[creation:creation]] of [[creation:Marlien]] which is a [[:half-breed]] of [[:succubus]] and [[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#memitim]].

She is a favoured [[wp>Fourth_wall]]-breaking and world-breaking tool of the writer, frequently referencing things from [[creation:Totum]] or [[creation:Totum|the real world]] despite no in-universe explanation for why she might be able to travel between [[creation:creation|creations]]. She also makes direct appearances before mortals on [[planes:Material]] of [[creation:Marlien]] and otherwise flouts the the laws of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] to an extent, making excuses that due to her imperfect heritage she finds it difficult to properly transpose herself to the right time or location. As a result, she is at the centre of [[planes:Material|Material Plane]] legends of the [[blackbird|Blackbird]].
