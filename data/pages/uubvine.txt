====== Uubvine ======
Uubvine was a cult or civilisation centred around [[:Vinewyltt]], occupying the towering citadel [[:Vinthak]], close northward from [[:Emero Wydth]]. The cult began to gather around [[:vinewyltt]] quite early on in the [[:paraesi:north_sea:golden age]], but became a fully-fledged city state far later - perhaps a few hundred years before the [[first_north_sea_fiend_storm]].
