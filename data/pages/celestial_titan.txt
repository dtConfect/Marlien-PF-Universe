====== Celestial Titan ======
The Celestial Titan is a colossal entity whose presence within [[planes:celestial]] is utterly pervasive. The titan is a living vessel, perhaps a manifestation of a [[creation:true_creation:god]], though it is entirely passive and not wholly corporeal. Where it manifests physically, or at least visibly, within [[planes:celestial]], it bears the distinctive traits of an arthropod, with great, sweeping flanks of bright white chitin, tufts of poly-chromatic hair, and laced or feathered wings.
