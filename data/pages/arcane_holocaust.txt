====== Arcane Holocaust ======
The Arcane Holocaust was the conflict between the ancient civilisations of [[:Graadien]] and [[:Darohl]] culminating in the development and deployment of the [[:soul_bomb]] against [[:Darohl]], and subsequent [[:Graadien#sacking]] of [[:Graadien]] by the [[:creation:true_creation:charon]].

===== Soul Bombs =====
[[:Soul_bomb]]s were used in the holocaust from the moment of their invention, and each one differed as [[:Graadien]] mages experimented with different techniques. Generally speaking, those used nearest to their invention were the most physically destructive and magically contaminating, with later bombs designed either to destroy a limited area or populace, while leaving any desirable assets or territories nearby uncontaminated. This advancement was largely owed to a design which captured the energy of a soul bomb and channeled it inward, into a [[:mana_crystal]], containing arcane corruption and reducing the chance of a chain reaction.

Because of this, the remains of [[:Darohl]] most highly corrupted and dangerous at the [[:year_zero]] are those near the center, where the earliest, most destructive weapons were intended to cause the most damage and terror as possible. The innermost holds of [[:Darohl]] remain intact, though monsters descended from the events outside now roam those forgotten halls. The outskirts of the city are mostly intact - in part due to efforts to fortify and seal off the place by the last stragglers of its dying populace - with architecture still standing strong where the later soul bombs were detonated; they are, like the inner holds, patrolled by manifold horrors, but brave adventurers sometimes venture near for the promise of valuable [[:mana_crystals]] that might be found there.
