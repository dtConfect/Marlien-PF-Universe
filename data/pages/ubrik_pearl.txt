====== Ubrik Pearl ======
The Ubrik Pearl is an artefact of great power left behind by the [[creation:Marlien:dead_gods]], seemingly linked to the [[creation:marlien:dead_gods#Second]] of Dynamism, [[:Ubrikant]]. It permits its wielder incomparable control over their own form, and that of their surroundings, being capable even of changing the form of those otherwise restricted by the will of the [[creation:marlien:dead_gods]] themselves, such as the [[creation:true_creation:charon#immortals|Charon Immortals]].

The pearl's own form is similarly dynamic, and can easily be altered by its weilder, or any venturing nearby if it is left unattended. For the majority of history it has been held by the [[:charis]] founder, [[:Hera]], who variably wears it as jewellery, or stands it beside herself in the form of a huge, ornately decorated egg.
