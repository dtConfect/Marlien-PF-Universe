====== Jinxi ======
Jinxi (Jin-she) is a kinesis-reactive material found usually, but not always, upon [[:planet]]s which lie outside of the main atmosphere of [[:Marlien]] and connected [[:spire]]s. It is light-weight, hard, brittle, translucent at most natural densities, and can be dyed virtually any colour.

===== Applications =====
==== Xiexio ====
The [[:Xiexio]] use Jinxi for many purposes, including, but not limited to, personal transport, clothing and jewelery, weaponry, and hands-free interfaces. [[:Xiexio]] [[:spacecraft]] or other vehicles designed for individual control and transportation are often so modular in design and so saturated with Jinxi that the entire vessel can be moved about the operator to expose different systems for maintenance, inspection, or usage, rather than the operator having to move through. For larger vessels this design is both impractical and dangerous, as multiple [[:Xiexio]] would struggle to coordinate the manipulation of Jinxi without some additional telepathic aid.
