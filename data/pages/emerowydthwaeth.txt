===== History =====
===== Origins =====

===== Golden Age =====

==== Weathering the Storm ====
The city [[:Emero_wydth]] was felled near-instantaneously at the beginning of the [[:first_north_sea_fiend_storm]], and the majority of the people died with it.

==== Aftermath ====
What few of these [[:Elfin]] people remained after the [[:first_north_sea_fiend_storm|fiend storm]] lived among the [[:Warelin]] peoples.

==== Exodus ====
In the [[:Year of Fire]], when the [[:Warelin]] peoples were forced to migrate away, most of the Emerowaeth returned to [[:planes:feywild]], or else deep into the forests.

==== Post Ice Age ====
Many descendants of the Emerowaeth were so changed by their ancestors' time spent on [[:planes:material]] that they could not easily adapt back to life in [[:planes:feywild]], and so they remain on [[:planes:material]], living in the forests as guardians of the portals.
