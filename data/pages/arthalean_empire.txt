====== The Arthaelean Empire ======
The Arthalean Empire once stretched from the eastern shore of the [[paraesi:north_sea|North Sea]] of [[Paraesi]], almost to the western shore of the [[dire_sea|Dire Sea]]. It was founded around 1,294 [[calendar|BC]] by the first emporer [[Sherum-Ishtar]], and collapsed somewhere between 224 [[calendar|BC]] and 208 [[calendar|BC]], the reign of the final emporer [[Wurnstal]].

After the fall of the Empire the most significant emerging factions were the kingdoms of [[Vangrund]] and [[Grayvaene]], and the [[temple_protectorate_of_arthale:Temple Protectorate of Arthale]].
