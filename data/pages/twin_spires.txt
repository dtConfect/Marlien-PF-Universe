====== The Twin Spires ======
The Twin Spires [[#one]] and [[#two]] area pair of [[Spire]]s in [[creation:Marlien]] which are positioned closely enough to one another that their atmospheres are connected from toe to tip, the form of each can be clearly discerned from the ground of the other, and inter-spire travel has long been practiced not only by magically or technologically gifted humanoids, but also by native wildlife.
