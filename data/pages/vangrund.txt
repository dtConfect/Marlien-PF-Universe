====== Vangrund ======
Vangrund was one of the nations emerging from the collapse of the [[Arthalean Empire]] - a kingdom based around the land to the south-east of the [[paraesi:north sea]] of [[paraesi]]. It was founded when the church of [[religion:Solenist Academia]] presented to the public the boy who would become the first king of Vangrund, [[Rinus Sangey]], who they proclaimed to be of the same blood as the Emperors, and the nearest they would find to the rightful heir to the throne. By all accounts young [[Rinus Sangey]] was charismatic, and held a certain religious significance in coming from the Solenist monasteries, where he was kept chaste and groomed for induction into the faith until his ascension to the throne.
