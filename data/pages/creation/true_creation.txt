====== True Creation ======
By the understanding of the [[creation:true_creation:soul steward]]s and other [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], True creation is an infinite, a-temporal space of infinite dimensions, occupied by a finite number of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] and endless supply of unbound [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]. It is all things simoultaneously, forever and for a single moment.

===== Appearance =====
True Creation bears no physics which allow for it to have any appearance in the manner of [[creation:creation#conventional]] [[creation:creation|creations]], however it may have an appearance if veiwed from within a [[creation:creation]], such as during the final moments of a [[creation:creation]]'s collapse due to [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] depletion. In such cases its infinite nature creates an impression of simoultaneous perfect white completeness and still black emptiness.

===== Creations =====
A connected mass, or 'lake' of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]-infused [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] within True Creation, or that store of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]], and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] within a [[creation:girdle]], is commonly refereed to as a [[creation:creation]].

==== Transference ====
Due to the nature of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|time]] and the infinity of True Creation, a mass of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]-infused [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] which is separated from another is permenantly separated, and incapable of ever rejoining its original [[creation:creation]], or of joining another. Normal travel between [[creation:creation|creations]] is thereby impossible, as is the conept of [[time travel]], which would otherwise be an inevitable by-product of such travel.

===== Unity =====
Because all of True Creation is understood to exist in a single, infinite moment of balance, the concept of unity allows that all creations are in-fact interconnected. Among other implications, this theoretically allows for the circumvention of mechanics which otherwise prevent [[#Transference]], and even allows for events such as [[creation:creation]]-collisions, temporal intersections between [[creation:creation|creations]], and more - though all such things, including [[#Transference]], must be [[creation:predestined event]]s, or both [[creation:creation|creations]] involved must share some [[creation:internal mechanism]] for direct [[#Transference]] from one to the other.

===== Nature =====
Understanding of the nature of existence only reaches so high as the [[creation:true_creation:soul steward]]s and other [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], who being unbound or bound to [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity]]s of their own making understand their place in the [[creation:true_creation:balance]]. Therefore, whether or not this a-temporal [[creation:true_creation:balance]] exists within a yet grander scheme can only be theorised.

==== Chaotic Theory ====
It is possible that True Creation is but a single infinitesimal moment in a purely chaotic world, which is randomised moment to moment.

==== Meta-timeline Theory ====
It is possible that True Creation is but a single infinitesimal moment in a sequence of single, infinitesimal moments each near-indiscernible from the next, or that its entire breadth and variance represents the entirety of such a timeline too great for any [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] to perceive.

==== Stagnation Theory ====
It is possible that True Creation is the inert, post-apocalyptic aftermath of a once-temporal super-creation in which free [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] fought with [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]] over [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]; where [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] were created and destroyed, rather than just existing in a balanced, static state.
