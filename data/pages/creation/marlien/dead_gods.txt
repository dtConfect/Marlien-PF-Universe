====== Dead Gods ======
The Dead Gods were the [[creation:true_creation:god]] creators of [[creation:Marlien]], so called by the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] because they seem to have at one time entered into their [[creation:creation]], but then [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction|destroyed themselves]].

===== History =====
The dead gods, which may in fact have been one, singular entity, are thought to have been the primary sculptors of [[creation:Marlien]], and entered into it at the dawn of time. They created the first [[progenitors|progenitor race]] to help them shape their creation during its first aeons, during which the most part of the [[planes:planes]] were divided, and the vast, stony, non-euclidean landscape of [[planes:Material]] were carved out.

[[creation:Marlien]] was made highly morphic by the standard of other [[creation:creation]]s, and the creators wielded such vast quantities of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] that they could reshape it instantaneously and near-infinite times in pursuit of a perfection they could not achieve from [[creation:true_creation:beyond|outside]] of its [[creation:girdle|walls]].

This perfection though, proved to be unachievable even which such proximity and precision: the dead gods were too much in disarray, pursuing too many competing goals, leading to a growth of internal conflict which prevented them from ever agreeing on the direction of any iteration. During the final iteration of [[creation:Marlien]], as the first [[progenitors|progenitor race]] continued to toil away,, after umpteenth creation and dissatisfaction with the second [[progenitors|progenitor race]], the dead gods sat in thought so intense that they were, whether intentionally or not, suddenly [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|torn apart by their own will]], releasing such a force of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] that has not been seen within [[creation:Marlien]] since.

In this event the [[creation:Marlien]] [[creation:girdle]] was infused with such a quantity of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] that the [[creation:true_creation:charon|resident soul stewards]] together no longer wield enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to tear it down should they decide that the [[creation:creation]] is too hazardous for the resident [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. As a result, they settled in for the long-haul, carving out their own plane, [[planes:halls_of_the_charon]], and creating a legion of [[creation:true_creation:charon#mortals|charon mortals]] to help guard the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]].

===== Dissonance =====
The dissonance of the dead gods are a personification of their incompatible desires which lead to their indefinite pursuit of perfection, and eventual [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|destruction]]. It is impossible to define whether the dead gods were one [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] or many, nor what the impact of their individuals might have been before their [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|destruction]], and so only the dissonance are named.
