====== Dead Gods ======
The Dead Gods were the [[creation:true_creation:god]] creators of [[creation:Marlien]], so called by the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] because they seem to have at one time entered into their [[creation:creation]], and yet by its rules destroyed themselves. Their [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman|souls]], howeve, must still reside somewhere within.
