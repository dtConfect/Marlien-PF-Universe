====== Dead Gods ======
The Dead Gods were the [[creation:true_creation:god]] creators of [[creation:Marlien]], so called by the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] because they seem to have at one time entered into their [[creation:creation]], but then [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction|destroyed themselves]].
The Dead Gods are [[creation:true_creation:god]] or [[creation:true_creation:god]]s which created [[creation:Marlien]]. The name first came from the mouths of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], given both to the [[#true]] creator or creators which afterward entered into [[creation:Marlien]], and the [[#second]], who were created by the [[soul_fission|fission]] of the [[#true]].

===== History =====
The dead gods, which may in fact have been one, singular entity, were the primary sculptors of [[creation:Marlien]].

Deeming their view from [[creation:true_creation:beyond|beyond]] its [[creation:girdle|walls]] too imprecise and warped by the actions of lesser [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] through [[creation:internal_mechanisms]] of their own making, the dead gods entered into it [[creation:Marlien]] at the dawn of time with the intent to reform it drastically from within, where they could see more clearly, and act as a guiding hand for all time. Upon entry into their [[creation:creation]], and first perception of temporal existence, however, the dead gods realised immediately that their own perfectionist nature and competing goals would lead to naught but an eternal cycle of destruction and redesign; this was the true cause of the lack of clarity they perceived from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] - not the actions of lesser [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], but of themselves.

Whether an outcome of rational thought, or a product of their [[#dissonance]], the gods were then [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|torn apart by their own will]], showering all [[creation:Marlien]] with vast quantities of undirected [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]], and yet leaving the world for the most part as they had sculpted it from [[creation:true_creation:beyond|outside]].

In this event the [[creation:Marlien]] [[creation:girdle]] was infused with such a quantity of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] that the [[creation:true_creation:charon|resident soul stewards]] together do not wield enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to tear it down should they decide that the [[creation:creation]] is too hazardous for resident [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. As a result, they have settled in for the long-haul, carving out their own plane, [[planes:halls_of_the_charon]], and creating a legion of [[creation:true_creation:charon#mortals|charon mortals]] to help guard the other trapped [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]].

===== Dissonance =====
The dissonance of the dead gods are a personification of their incompatible desires which lead to their indefinite pursuit of perfection, and eventual [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|destruction]]. It is impossible to define whether the dead gods were one [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] or many, nor what the impact of their individuals might have been before their [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction#obliteration|destruction]], and so only the dissonance are named.
