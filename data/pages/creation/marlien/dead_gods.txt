====== Dead Gods ======
The Dead Gods were the [[creation:true_creation:god]] creators of [[creation:Marlien]], so called by the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] because they seem to have at one time entered into their [[creation:creation]], but then [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction|destroyed themselves]].
The Dead Gods are [[creation:true_creation:god]] or [[creation:true_creation:god]]s which created [[creation:Marlien]]. The name first came from the mouths of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], given both to the [[#true]] creator or creators which afterward entered into [[creation:Marlien]], and the [[#second]], who were created by the [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]] of the [[#true]].

===== True =====
The creator or creators named the True [[creation:true_creation:god]]s of [[creation:Marlien]] entered into it at the dawn of time, and were responsible for the creation of the [[marlien:first progenitor race]], which they interacted with somewhat before the [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]].

==== Other Names ====
  * First
  * Creators
  * Makers

===== Second =====
The Second resulted from the [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]] of the [[#True]] Because the second form of the dead gods dwelt in [[creation:Marlien]] for a time, and held dominion over mortals, they came to be given ancient names, which became their true names. Each embodied one motivation of the [[#True]], and was almost single-minded in its pursuit - especially regarding the creation of the [[marlien:second progenitor race]].

  * [[:Thechtonon]], Second of Knowledge
  * [[:Hlidera]], Second of Beauty
  * [[:Ubrikant]], Second of Dynamism
  * [[:Betrodum]], Second of [[creation:predestined_event|Predestination]]
  * [[:Gelfexinerey]], Second of [[creation:Magic|Magiks]]
  * [[:Sathlid]], Second of Luck

===== History =====
The [[#True]] entered into [[creation:Marlien]] at the dawn of time, deeming their view from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] too imprecise and warped by the manipulation by lesser [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atam]] of its [[creation:internal_mechanisms]]. They intended to reform it drastically from within, where they could more clearly witness the results of their changes, and act as a guiding hand for all time. They were greeted at their arrival by the [[marlien:first progenitor race]], whom they had prepared ahead to aid them in sculpting the early world.

Upon entry into their [[creation:creation]] and first perception of temporal existence, however, the [[#First]] realised almost immediately that their own perfectionist nature and competing goals would lead to naught but a cycle of destruction and redesign which would last until the end of time; this was the primary cause of the lack of clarity they had perceived from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] - far more disruptive than the actions of lesser [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. With a few words to the [[marlien:first progenitor race]] they then engineered, much to the dismay of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], their own [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]], dividing their desires into the [[#Second]], that they may come to some imperfect solution to their disparate desires through conflict and natural selection, rather than endless deliberation. In this [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]] the [[#True]] created one entity above all others - a lesser form of their whole, to observe the actions of the [[#Second]] and see that all was not turned to ruin, and it was called the [[marlien:Arbiter]].

The [[#Second]] did a great many things across the world, and resolved for the most part all disputes through compromise, but their focus met eventually on the creation of a second race, for they grew tired of the short-lived, heavy-handed, dim-witted [[marlien:first progenitor race]]. In creation of the [[marlien:second progenitor race]] they found themselves not in conflict with eachother, however, but with their own wilful, precocious, magically gifted, long lived, and intelligent creation, which seemed to both twist and exceed their design at every opportunity. Furthermore, they desired the removal of the [[marlien:first progenitor race]] now that the world was mostly formed, but the giant sculptors filled the [[marlien:second progenitor race]] with wonder, and they  and so not all were complicit in the [[#Second]]s' effort to destroy them. While there was some conflict, the vast majority of the [[marlien:second progenitor race]] were quickly turned to the defence of their predecessors, which would have been hopeless were it not for the secret support of the [[marlien:Arbiter]].

Unions between the [[marlien:first progenitor race]] and the [[marlien:second progenitor race]] produced the [[marlien:human progenitor race]], a race sharing in the strengths of both their progenitors: wise, tough, hard workers, and incredibly inventive. [[marlien:human progenitor race]]s bred far more quickly than the short-lived [[marlien:first progenitor race]] or the immortal [[marlien:second progenitor race]], and soon were the most numerous of the three peoples. What is more, they were more fickle than the [[marlien:second progenitor race]]: they lived longer lives than the [[marlien:first progenitor race]], and long enough to become discontent that they could not enjoy the immortality of the [[marlien:second progenitor race]]. They were easily swayed by the machinations of the [[#Second]], and moved to the betrayal of, and war against their parent races.

There was great conflict in the unified cities of the three races, and eventually the majority of the [[marlien:human progenitor race]] were outcast. With the hardiness of the [[marlien:first progenitor race]] and the intellect and cunning of the [[marlien:second progenitor race]] these [[marlien:human progenitor race]] began to reshape the world outside to their liking, building their own cities with ease, along with temples from which to worship the [[#Second]].

At this point, the most-part of the [[#Second]] were pleased with the [[marlien:human progenitor race]], who fulfilled all their original desires accordingly, not exceeding or twisting their design, and being well obedient. The [[marlien:Arbiter]] too was pleased, and being the most powerful remnant of the [[#True]], seeing that the [[#Second]] had fulfilled their purpose, moved to bring about their end. The means by which this was done is unknown, but it resulted in a massive release of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], and left almost no trace of the [[#True]], the [[#Second]], or the [[marlien:Arbiter]]. 

In this event the [[creation:Marlien]] [[creation:girdle]] was infused with such a quantity of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] that the [[creation:true_creation:charon|resident soul stewards]] together do not wield enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to tear it down should they decide that the [[creation:creation]] is too hazardous for resident [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. As a result, they have settled in for the long-haul, carving out their own plane, [[planes:halls_of_the_charon]], and creating a legion of [[creation:true_creation:charon#mortals|charon mortals]] to help guard the other trapped [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]].

===== Remnants =====
The entity [[:Tingma]] is a remnant of the removal of these [[creation:true_creation:god]]s, perhaps a fraction resulting from further [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]] and [[creation:true_creation:soul_fusion|fusion]] of the [[#Second]].

The [[#Second]] [[:Thechtonon]] sought some method of avoiding this final removal from the world, possibly by encasing itself in a physical body of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]-infused [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]], the corpse of which still floats through [[planes:solitude]], concealing a vast reservoir of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]].
