====== Girdle ======
A girdle is a semi-permeable membrane of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]-infused [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] separating a [[creation:creation]] from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]].

It serves as an advanced form of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|vessel]], retains a great many [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. While a new [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] may enter into the timeline of the [[creation::creation]] at any point, bringing with it a store of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], this is the only method by which new [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] may enter. No [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] may thereafter leave, nor any [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] except by a [[#fissure]]. [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Anicca]] is permitted to travel freely into and out of a girdle.

A girdle need not appear at any literal location within the [[creation:creation]]'s space.

===== Fissure =====
A fissure is an artefact in a girdle which allows for [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to leave its [[creation:creation]] into [[creation:true_creation:beyond]]. These frequently feature in the design of [[creation:creation]]s as a method of restricting their [[creation:creation#lifespan]].

Just as with the girdle, a fissure need not appear at any literal location, but it may do so even if the girdle itself does not. [[wp>Black hole]]s in [[creation:Totum]] are an example of [[#faux-fissure]]s appearing at a physical location, while the [[creation:Totum]] girdle itself does not.

==== Faux-fissure ====
A faux-fissure may appear to any educated perception to be a [[#fissure]], but in fact siphons [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] into a bladder rather than into [[creation:true_creation:beyond]]. [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] may then be brought back into the [[creation:creation]] by some [[creation:internal mechanism]], or [[creation:predestined event]].
