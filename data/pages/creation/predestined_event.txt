====== Predestined Event ======
A predestined event is some arbitrary movement of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] and/or [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] within a [[creation:creation]], as defined by the [[[[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] of those [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] who had a part in its creation. It differs from an [[creation:internal_mechanism]] in that it is designed to deny or defeat [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] agency, rather than encourage it. Still, predestined events are not above manipulation by a singular or collective of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], just as any aspect of [[creation:creation#fate]], even the [[creation:creation#lifespan]] of the [[creation:creation]].
