====== Creation ======
A creation is a self-sustaining reality conjured from the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements|primordial elements]] of existence. Being saturated with [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], it is a pocket of temporal existence separated from the a-temporal [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] by a [[creation:girdle]].

===== Lifespan =====
A creation's lifespan is generally as long as its creator or creators willed it to be. The circumstances of its demise are also defined by the creator. Sufficient [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] wielded by a single, or collective of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] may be enough to alter the [[#fate]] of the creation to such an extent as to delay its demise, but this generally requires action by sufficiently powerful [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], or a release of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] by [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] only achievable through [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction]].

The [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] consumption required to sustain the [[creation:girdle]] alone typically means that only support from within by a very powerful [[creation:true_creation:god]] can sustain a [[creation:creation]] indefinitely. Further, some creations are made with a [[creation:girdle#fissure]] that leaks [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] into the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]], drawing the world towards a slow starvation in which the [[creation:girdle|boundaries]] of reality close in , and there is insufficient [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] within for any [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] to hold them at bay.

===== Fate =====
Because all the temporal existence of a creation sits within the a-temporal [[creation:true_creation]], and is shaped for the most part by those interested [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] named the creators of it, having a view upon the entire temporal painting of the creation in its sculpting, it may be said that there is a certain amount of predestination and fate within it.

This is, however, not absolute: every [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] with an interest may have diverted a part of its [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] towards the sculpting of a creation, whether it entered into it or not, and yet further lack of precision is introduced by the unpredictable manner in which any [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] might manipulate the creation once placed into temporal existance - especially those brought in with their own agenda, or [[creation:true_creation:balance|against their will]].

In fact, many creations seem to be deliberately designed with complex [[creation:internal mechanism]]s to ensure emergent behaviour, and a lack of specificity or precision in design.
