====== Creation ======
The term 'creation' refers to a self-sustaining reality conjurred from the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements|primordial elements]] of existance. Typically a creation exists within a pocket of the vast fields of [[planes:Solitude]], and as such cannot be reached through regular navigation of [[planes:Solitude]].

Though described above as self-sustaining, a creation requires only [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], and may be either devoid of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#time]], or temporal.
