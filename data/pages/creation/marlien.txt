====== Marlien ======
Marlien is a [[creation:magic|magical]] [[creation:creation]] within the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] which was constructed by the [[creation:marlien:Dead Gods]].
===== Names =====
Marlien is known by many names:
  * **Marlien** - from the parable of [[religion:solenist_academia|Solen and Marlien]] in the [[:arthale|Arthalean]] religion [[religion:solenist_academia|Solenist Academia]], where it is the name of the creator, or sleeping godess who dreams creation.

===== Topography =====
Marlien is a poly-dimensional [[Creation:Creation]] whose structure can be divided into three, discrete [[planes:planes]]: the [[:Immaterium]], [[:Ethereal]], and [[:Materium]]. In common parlance the [[:Immaterial]] is refered to as a 'higher' [[:planes:planes|plane]], but it is more appropriate to describe the [[:Material]] as the surface, then move deeper into the [[:Ethereal]], and then deeper still into the [[:Immaterium]], whose depths extend into a vast, unknown void. Within the [[:Materium]], Marlien is further divided into sub-[[planes:planes]], each having disparate topographies with some overlap, intersection, and imitation. These sub-[[planes:planes]] are often manifestations of [[:creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] expressed from greater depths, a product of residual [[:creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] from activities long ago, or merely the design of the [[creation:Marlien:Dead_Gods]]. The primary, most balanced and diverse, of these planes is named [[planes:material]].
