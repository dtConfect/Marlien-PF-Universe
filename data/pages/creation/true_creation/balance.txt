====== Balance ======
The balance of [[creation:true_creation]] as an a-temporal moment is such that it is both the origin and outcome of the temporal existence of all its temporal [[creation:creation]]s. Therefore, the combined output quantity and [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment]] of all [[creation:creation]]s must equal its input. The balance, or moment, may therefore be thought of as a statement or a compromise of the competing wills of all [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]].

If such a balance may be achieved through any combination of [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment]], [[creation:true_creation:soul_fusion]], [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission]], and [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction]], this would discount [[creation:true_creation#Stagnation Theory]].

===== Roles of Atman =====
Each caste and category of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] takes on a roll in the balance of [[creation:true_creation]] which affects their experience within [[creation:creation]].

==== Divine ====
=== Gods ===
[[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] are typically the primary sculptors of a [[creation:creation]], having enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] at their disposal to render that wielded by lesser [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] insignificant. Those which take an active role in the sculpture of a [[creation:creation]] may be named [[creation:true_creation:god]]s.

=== Soul Stewards ===
[[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s dedicate themselves to the conservation and enrichment of all [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. Typically they individually wield less [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] than [[creation:true_creation:god]]s, and so they work in concert from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] to ensure that the form of a [[creation:creation]] will not harm resident [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. Due to the [[creation:creation#fate|lack of precision]] in [[creation:creation]], however, [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s often enter in to [[creation:creation]]s to more closely guard [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] - though they are then bound by the [[creation:internal_mechanism]]s largely under the control of [[creation:true_creation:god]]s. They may also be brought into a [[creation:creation]] against their will by a strong enough [[creation:true_creation:god]].

Usually, the [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s manage to ensure that there is some mechanism by which a [[creation:creation]]s [[creation:creation#lifespan]] can be cut short from the inside, should it appear to be too hazardous, but this is not always possible.

==== Mortal ====
[[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Mortal]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] generally wield too little excess [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to have any significant influence on the form, [[creation:internal_mechanism]]s, and [[creation:predestined_event]]s of a [[creation:creation]]. Furthermore, they are often bound to a [[creation:creation]] at the whim of a [[creation:true_creation:god]], rather than by their own volition, and once there may be swept about and bound to [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|vessels]] at the pleasure of [[creation:true_creation:god]]s and [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s.

==== Hunger ====
[[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Hunger]] are a destructive force which typically has no interest in taking part in [[creation:creation]]s, and so the strongest are rarely bound to them. Weaker [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Hunger]] sometimes enter into [[creation:creation]]s by the will of [[creation:true_creation:god]]s, but the [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s always strive to prevent this.
