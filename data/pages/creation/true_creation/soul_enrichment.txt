====== Soul Enrichment ======
Soul Enrichment is the process by which an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] is enriched or marred during participation in a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity]]. The exact effect of this is unseen in [[creation:true_creation]], where all is unchanging, but the balance of [[creation:true_creation]] is dependant upon the final state of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] at the collapse of a [[creation:creation]].

The enrichment of an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] contrbutes directly to its capacity for [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Mana]] production, allowing an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] to move between being [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Divine]], [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Mortal]], or [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Hunger]]. This is why individual [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity]] vessels of particular enlightenment might begin to exhibit extraordinary abilities.
