====== Soul Steward ======
The Soul Stewards are an order of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] dedicated to conservation and enrichment of all [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], including those involved in any [[creation:creation]].

Typically Soul Stewards operates from [[creation:true_creation:beyond]], working in concert to overpower the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]] of other [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] and ensure that their [[creation:creation]]s do not put them at risk. When they do enter into a [[creation:creation]], however, Soul Stewards always enter at the very begining.
