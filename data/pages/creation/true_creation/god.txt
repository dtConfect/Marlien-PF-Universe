====== God ======
Gods are an order of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] which participated in the creation of, and shaping of [[creation:creation|creations]]. The way that gods interect with their [[creation:creation|creations]], and those of others, varies: some remain in the a-temporal space of [[creation:true_creation]], while others enter into [[creation:creation]]s, and some of those choose even to craft or otherwise interact with them from within - again in varying ways. Some may choose to ignore their potential and live out ordinary lives amongst oter [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|creatures]] in a world, while others serve as deities and forces of nature. Both internal and external gods are capable of interacting with entities within their [[creation:creation]]; a external god holds more power, but is generally more detached from the reality of its [[creation:creation]] - colder less caring. Due to the a-temporal nature of [[creation:True_creation]], a god may even choose to enter into multiple [[creation:creation|creations]].

The definition of God may also include [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]]s who enter into a [[creation:creation]] or take an active interest in its design.

===== Entry =====
Gods may choose to enter a [[creation:creation]] at any time in its own temporal structure, or even to come and go, but such a decision is made prior to first entry, when the god exists outside of the [[creation:creation]], with a full overview of its form. Many then within a [[creation:creation]] are bound by their own immutable will; some even forget, over time, why they made the decisions they did, and choose to lie dormant until they remember what they were intending to do.
