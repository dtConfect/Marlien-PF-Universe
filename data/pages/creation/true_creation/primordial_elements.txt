====== Primordial Elements ======
The primordial elements of creation are [[#Atman]], [[#Mana]], and [[#Anicca]]. These are further divided into the [[#plentiful]] and the [[#scarce]].

===== Anicca =====
Anicca, also called 'grey matter', is the fundamental physical matter of all, and the only infinite primordial element. In its default state it is a colourless immaterial, and it can maintain no form without the exertion of [[#divine]] will represented by [[#mana]].

===== Mana =====
Mana, also known as 'time', or 'permenance', is the will of an individual [[#atman]]. Mana is naturally generated by all [[#atman]] in differing quantities, but always enough to sustain their own existance. An [[#atman]] which ceases to generate enough mana to sustain its own existance becomes a [[#hunger]], which is fundamentally different. An [[#atman]] which has no mana ceases to, or does not, exist.

[[#Atman]] are capable of applying [[#mana]] to manipulate the form of [[#anicca]]. An instant of mana allows a mote of [[#anicca]] to maintain a form other than its default for just that instant, after which it reverts. [[#Anicca]] imbued with a larger quantity of mana enters into linear time, gradually depleting this resevoir of [[#mana]] until it finally revents to its default form. In this way, [[#anicca]], and thereby entire [[creation:creation|creations]], or [[#trinity|trinities]], are able retain a form even while unatended by an [[#atman]].

===== Atman =====
Atman are commonly known as souls. They are the nature of intelligent entities separated from the physical form of Anicca, and capable of manipulating the other primordial elements. Atman are further divided into [[#divine]] and [[#mortal]], and [[#hunger]], and may move between these divisions by means of [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment]]. They may also be [[creation:true_creation:soul_fusion|joined]], [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|split]], or even [[creation:true_creation:soul_destruction|destroyed]] outright through force of [[#mana|will]], or by the exploitation of certain physical structures, similarly to how a [[#trinity|vessel]] traps a soul.

==== Divine ==== 
Divine, or 'immortal', atman include [[creation:true_creation:god]]s, [[creation:true_creation:watcher]]s and [[creation:true_creation:soul steward]]s. The classification requires only that they produce [[#mana]] more quickly than it would be consumed by the [[#trinity|vessel]] required to trap them, but most far surpass this requirement. They are inately capable of manipulating [[#atman]], and due to their relative abundance of [[#mana]], may exert control over [[#anicca]] which is effectively indominable by [[#mortal]] [[#atman]].

==== Mortal ==== 
Mortal atman are those which produce [[#mana]] more slowly that the [[#trinity|vessel]] required to them, though most fall far below this mark. They are not inately capable of manipulating other [[#atman]] or large quantities of [[#mana]], though they may do so according to the laws of a [[creation:creation]] (see [[creation:magic#arcane|arcane magic]]).

==== Hunger ====
A Hunger is any atman which produces less [[#mana]] than it requires to sustain its own existance. They are neither [[#divine]] nor [[#mortal]] because the rate of [[#mana]] consumption by a [[#trinity|vessel]] sufficient to trap them, as well as their capacity for manipulating [[#mana]] and [[#atman]], is directly proportional to their current resevoir of [[#mana]]. Hunger are usually malicous and seek to sustain their own existance by feeding upon the [[#mana]] resevoirs of other atman.

===== Trinity =====
[[#Anicca]] imbued with [[#mana]] may be formed into a [[#trinity|vessel]] suitable to trap an [[#atman]]. The quantity of [[#anicca]] and [[#mana]] required to form a vessel suitable to trap an [[#atman]] differs greatly, and the [[#mana]] requirement includes, but is not limited to that required to sustain the form of the [[#anicca]]. Such a [[#trinity|vessel]] retaining an [[#atman]] forms a trinity otherwise known as [[creation:true_creation:life]], from which it is not trivial to separate any element even if the retained [[#atman]] is [[#mortal]] and the agent of separation is [[#immortal]]. The [[#mana]], or will, that the trinity is imbued with is given to the restrained [[#atman]] to use to control the [[#anicca]], or even other [[#anicca]] surrounding it (see [[creation:magic#arcane|arcane magic]]). The most effective way to break the trinity of life is to sufficiently damage either the [[#anicca]] or [[#mana]] it is composed of (collectively named the 'vessel'), such that it can no longer restrain the [[#atman]].

While the [[#atman]] may be [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment|enriched or marred]] by such an experience, memories collated are encrypted in some fashion which means that they may be beyond recovery without some sample of the original [[#trinity|vessel]] by which they were generated.

The [[creation:marlien:girdle]] of [[creation:marlien]] is an exceptional example of such a vessel, trapping many [[#atman]], and vast resevoir of [[#mana]] whch is not bound to any particular [[#anicca]].
