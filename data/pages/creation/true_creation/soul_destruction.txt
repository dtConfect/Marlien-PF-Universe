====== Soul Destruction ======
Soul Destruction refers to the destruction of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] by force of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]], consumption by [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]], [[#digestion]] in a [[soul gigerium]] or [[soul cauldron]], or by other means.

===== Consumption =====
A [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]] leaches [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] from another [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] without damaging the [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment|enrichment]] of the victim, though such a victim may still be destroyed if it does not produce [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] more quickly than the parasite takes it. Such a destruction is referred to as consumption.

Leaching of a soul leading toward final consumption may be a swift and silent or slow and subtle experience.

===== Digestion =====
[[soul gigerium]] and [[soul cauldron]]s are two physical constructions which function in a very similar way, leaching mana from an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] similarly to a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]], and feeding it into some receptacle - often another [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. While digestion in this manner harms the [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment|enrichment]] of the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] digested, eventually depriving it of its ability to produce enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to sustain itself, it does not serve to enrich the receptacle.

The digestion of a soul is a painful and deeply traumatising experience at any rate.

===== Obliteration =====
Obliteration refers to the instantaneous destruction of an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] and release of all stored [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]. It is a violent phenomenon from which it is difficult to harvest the resultant energy.

==== In Magic Rituals ====
While many forms of [[creation:magic#arcane]] ritual requiring the sacrifice of living beings require only the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] release of bodily destruction, the most potent may seek that released by [[#obliteration]] of a soul instead. In the case of [[creation:magic#faux divine]] rituals - those which appeal to some higher power, likely an [[:alignment:evil]] [[:outsider]] in this case - it is likely that souls exchanged in the ritual are required to be transferred directly to the source of the power, to do with as it pleases, rather than destroyed in any way during the ritual itself.
