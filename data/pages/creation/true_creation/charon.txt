====== Charon ======
Charon are the stewards of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman|souls]] in [[creation:Marlien]], and part of a larger order of [[creation:true_creation:primordial entities]] which preside over all of [[creation:creation]]. They may be divided into a number of castes, some of which are incarnations of [[creation:true_creation:primordial entities]] bound to [[creation:Marlien]], while others are mortal compositions of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]]. They all reside together in the [[planes:Halls of the Charon]].

===== Castes of Charon =====
==== Immortals ====
The immortals are the original [[creation:true_creation:primordial entities]] from [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] [[creation:Marlien]] who were tethered to it, and now serve as the leaders of all charon. Though they are not forced to assume a physical form within this world, that which they are able to assume was dictated by the [[creation:marlien:dead gods]]. They are unwilling prisoners of this creation, locked within it with the souls they seek to protect, until the [[creation:marlien:end of time]].

==== Mortals ====
The mortal races of the charon were created by the immortals to bolster their number, serving as their agents and footsoldiers accross [[creation:Marlien]]. Most were created by imbuing creatures taken from the [[planes:planes]] with something of the immortals' nature. This process forever alters the mortal [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman|soul]], and so is considered a desparate measure; the souls of mortal charon are only ever reincarnated in other charon, and it is rare that more are ever created. Though the immortals are capable of manifesting new physical bodies of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], most mortal charon are also capable of biological reproduction - some even retain the sexual compatability of the progenitor species.
