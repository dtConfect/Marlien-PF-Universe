====== Charon ======
Charon are the [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward|stewards]] of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman|souls]] in [[creation:Marlien]], and part of a larger order of [[creation:true_creation:soul steward]]s which preside over all of [[creation:creation]]. They may be divided into a number of castes, some of which are incarnations of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman]] bound to [[creation:Marlien]], while others are mortal compositions of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]]. They all reside together in the [[planes:Halls of the Charon]].

===== Castes of Charon =====
==== Immortals ====
The immortals are the original [[creation:true_creation:soul steward]]s from [[creation:true_creation:beyond|beyond]] [[creation:Marlien]] who were tethered to it, and now serve as the leaders of all charon. Though they are not forced to assume a physical form within this world, that which they are able to assume was dictated by the [[creation:marlien:dead gods]]. Because the [[creation:true_creation:soul_fission|fission]] of the [[creation:Marlien:Arbiter]] and the [[creation:Marlien:dead_gods#second|Second dead gods]] of [[creation:Marlien]] bombarded the [[creation:girdle]] with such great quantities of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], the charon are unable to prematurely destroy it, and are locked within it with the souls they seek to protect, until the [[creation:marlien:end of time]].

==== Mortals ====
The mortal races of the charon were created by the immortals to bolster their number, serving as their agents and footsoldiers accross [[creation:Marlien]]. Most were created by imbuing creatures taken from the [[planes:planes]] with something of the immortals' nature. This process forever alters the mortal [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#Atman|soul]], and so is considered a desparate measure; the souls of mortal charon are only ever reincarnated in other charon, and it is rare that more are ever created. Though the immortals are capable of manifesting new physical bodies of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] and [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], most mortal charon are also capable of biological reproduction - some even retain the sexual compatability of the progenitor species.

=== Memitim ===
Memitim are the legionnaires of the charon, questing into the mortal realms to find newly freed [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman|souls]] before a fate worse than death consumes them, and there face off against the grasping things of [[planes:astral]] which congregate about, until the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman|soul]] drifts naturally toward, or can be safely guided to [[planes:everstair]].

=== Shoki ===
Shoki are the shepherds, counsellors, and wranglers of lingering souls, and one of the only human-like charon gifted with a bare-faced visage that will not immediately drive a mortal to madness - though the rest of their form seems to be in mockery of this. They wander the lands of mortals hunched staves, laden with baggage which is, on closer inspection, largely empty, used only to cover their spiral shell. There they seek out wayward and stubborn souls which have somehow escaped the grasping claws of [[planes:astral]].

=== Vanth ===
While the [[#Memitim]] are in the [[planes:Halls of the Charon]] they are expected to relax from combat duties, though they maintain other duties to the [[#Immortals]]. In the [[planes:Halls of the Charon]], therefore, it is instead the role of the tireless Vanth to ward off would-be intruders. Vanth are frightening to behold and considered inferior to the legions of [[#Memitim]], so are only generally taken abroad when great numbers are required for a battle or [[#intervention, or when a single [[#Memitim]] or [[#Shoki]] requires bodyguards.

===== Charon in Other Cultures =====
==== Haleysi, Agyanism ====
Some images and textual references to the charon were passed down through the [[Warelin]] people to the [[Haleysi]] and other [[Agyanist]] folk around the [[paraesi:North Sea]] of [[Paraesi]], who name them [[Extinguishers]] for their role in the destruction of the [[Goxon]] and [[Teigric]] peoples.

==== Arthale, Solenism ====
Some images and textual references to the charon were passed down through the [[Warelin]] people to the western folk of the Arthalean Empire and their inheritors. Here they are seen as agents of [[religion:solenist academia|the beast]], [[Erasors]], and enemies of [[religion:solenist academia|Solen]] for their role in the destruction of the [[Goxon]] and [[Teigric]] peoples, along with their vast stores of knowledge and technologies.
