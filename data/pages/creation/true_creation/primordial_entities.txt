====== Primordial Entities ======
Primordial entities are those entities which exist outside of any [[creation:creation]] and express aparent agency or complex behaviour independant of the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements|primordial elements]]. A primordial entity is usually composed of pure, divine [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], requiring no body of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]], and is capable of holding total dominion over any amount of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] it is capable of shaping. Such entities include [[Gods]], and the charon [[charon#immortals|immortals]]. These entities typically emerge within the [[creation:true_creation:beyond|Great Beyond]].
