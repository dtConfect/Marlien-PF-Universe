====== Primordial Entities ======
Primordial Entities are those entities which exist outside of any [creation:Creation] and express aparent agency or complex behaviour independant of the [[creation:true_creation:priomordial_elements#divine|Primordial Elements]] [[creation:true_creation:priomordial_elements#Mana]] and [[creation:true_creation:priomordial_elements#Anicca]]. Such entities include [[Gods]], and the [[Charon]]. These entities typically emerge within [[planes:Solitude]], though [[Gods]] often fold themselves into a [[planes:solitude#pocket]] of [[planes:Solitude]], and the [[Charon]] reside in their own [[planes:planes#primordial|primordial plane]].
