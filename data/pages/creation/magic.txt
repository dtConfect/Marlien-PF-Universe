====== Magic ======
Magic is a phenomenon in some [[creation:creation|creations]] allowing for the manipulation of the world by a [[creation:true_creation:trinity]] inhabbiting it, usually taking one of two forms: [[#divine]], and [[#arcane]].

===== Divine =====
Divine magic is the application of [[#mana]] under the dominion of a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] to some effect usually appealed for by a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] engaged in a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity]]. Unlike [[#arcane]] magic, divine magic requires that the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] in question still be existant.

True divine magic is near-impossible in the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]], where the creator [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#immortal|divine]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] are no longer existant.

===== Arcane =====
Arcane magic is the act of an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], usually [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]], manipulating larger quantities of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] by means of mechanics permitted by the [[creation:creation]]. This usually involves the expenditure of some small quantity of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]]-imbued [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#anicca]] as a catalyst to draw upon the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] reserves of the [[creation:creation]] or [[creation:true_creation:beyond]], and then the performance of some ritual to control it.

==== Faux Divine ====
Some [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#trinity|mortal]] entities within a [[creation:creation]] serve as subjects of whorship to others, and some such deities choose to answer appeals from these others with extensions of their own will, by arcane manipulation of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]], which may appear miraculous or divine to their whorshippers.
