====== Antheraea ======
Antheraea, the Golden Lady, the Moth Empress, is a [[Charis#Dea]] of the [[Charis]]. She rarely visits physically, preferring to hold congress in dreams and visions, where she appears as a giant woman with rosy skin, golden garments, and an enormous set of yellow moth's wings. In reality she is of no such great stature, though certainly larger than a [[human]] and possessed of wings and antennae like that of a moth. She wears a light suit of golden chitinous armour and a long, fabric skirt and a full helmet somewhat resembling the head and crest of a peacock. She favours throwing knives if she must fight, but also wields powerful magics of illusion.

Her chief concerns are fortune, charity, and [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment]].
