====== Volcano ======
A volcano is a rupture in the crust of [[creation:Marlien]] or on an individual a [[spire]] , such as [[Naltera]], that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface, comparable to a planetary [[wp>volcano]] in the creation of [[wp>universe|Totum]].

Volcanos occur both on [[spire|spires]], and on the mountainous plane itself, where they are often the route of interesting astrological and astonomic phenomenon, possibly including the birth of [[star|stars]].

[[planes:Planes]] and [[planes:planes#primordial|primordial planes]] may also have a type of volcano.
