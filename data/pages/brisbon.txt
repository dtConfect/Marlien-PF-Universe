====== Brisbon ======
Brisbon is a [[Charis#Dea]] of the [[Charis]] who is frequently aligned with holy warriors and [[alignment|good-aligned]] adventurers. Though he is frequently chastised by [[Hera]] and punished by the withholding of his borrowed power, he is quite direct in his interactions with [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]]s, prone to assigning them great quests, along with a gift of tangible power.

His usual symbols are the warhammer, and the mammoth.
