====== Brisbon ======
Brisbon is a [[Charis#Dea]] of the [[Charis]] who is frequently aligned with holy warriors and [[alignment|good-aligned]] adventurers. Though he is repeatedly chastised by [[Hera]] and punished by the withholding of his borrowed power, he remains ever direct in his interactions with [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]]s, prone to assigning them great quests, along with a gift of tangible power.

Brisbon's form is that of a muscular though aged humanoid who is rarely clad in the chitinous armour of his kin, preferring as little clothing as required to maintain the level of modesty appropriate for present company. His skin dark with complex tattoos, head to toe, which occasionally bear a blue sheen. From his face project two large tusks flanking a braided beard, and a mane of long hair flows from his head and back like a cape. The hair is consciously controlled and often shaped into a pair of majestic wings. From his tattoos he draws all manner of weapons, which he sometimes hands to [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]]s as a symbolic or literal gift of power, but he himself favours a great-hammer or blunt pole-arm.
