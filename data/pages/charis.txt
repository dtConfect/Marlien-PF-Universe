====== Charis ======
Charis are an offshoot of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] in the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]], serving under the [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|Immortal]] [[Heratrexisykeari]]. Unlike the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], who may generally be considered [[alignment:True Neutral]] or [[alignment:Lawful Neutral]], the Charis are generally [[alignment:Chaotic Good]], or [[alignment:Neutral Good]]. Thought their interference in [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] affairs is infrequent, they are generally more direct, and always less secretive.

The Charis reside in [[planes:celestial]] and have a strong affinity with [[creation:Marlien:Energy#Positive|Positive Energy]].

===== Appearance =====
[[Heratrexisykeari]] and her servants are, unlike the bleak legions of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], much-varied and glamorous. Their forms draw from all manner of creatures and art forms, mundane and magical, and they favour shining gold, silver, and bronze accented by bright blues, reds, greens, and yellows in intricate patterns. Where there is a large metalic surface, it tends to be curved and burnished to perfection. Where they take on animal aspects they draw from those which are similarly heavily patterned or feature bright flares of plumage or furs.

Having surpassed the limitations of form imposed upon them by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]], the one [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|Immortal]], [[Heratrexisykeari]], is not limited to a single form; she favours the appearance of peackocks and peahens, sometimes disguising herself as mundanely as that, other times taking the form of a humanoid woman in extravagant clothing, and even occasionally assuming the form of a [[creation:true_creation:charon#Yamaraj]] in jest, but with the visage of a peacock rather than a crow. Her servants too were freely shaped by her desires.
