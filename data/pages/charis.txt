====== Charis ======
Charis are an offshoot of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] in the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]], founded by [[Hera]], an ex-[[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|Immortal]]. Unlike the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], who may generally be considered [[alignment:True Neutral]] or [[alignment:Lawful Neutral]], the Charis are generally [[alignment:Chaotic Good]], or [[alignment:Neutral Good]]. Though their interference in [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] affairs is infrequent, they are generally more direct, and always less secretive than the [[creation:true_creation:Charon]].

The Charis reside in [[planes:celestial]] and have a strong affinity with [[creation:Marlien:Energy#Positive|Positive Energy]].

===== Origin =====
The Charis were founded by [[Hera]] when she laid claim to the [[Ubrik Pearl]], an artifact left behind by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]] themselves, perhaps for this precise purposed. The pearl relieves its bearer - even a [[creation:true_creation:Charon]] - of any bonds of form imposed upon themselves and its creations by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]], and so [[Hera]] was able to easily distinguish both herself and her subordinates from their peers.
===== Appearance =====
[[Hera]] and her servants exalt an aesthetic of intricacy and extravagance in all but their names, eschewing the complex naming conventions of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] along with the grim appearance imposed upon them by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]].

[[Heratrexisykeari]] and her servants are, unlike the bleak legions of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], much-varied and glamorous. Their forms draw from all manner of creatures and art forms, mundane and magical, and they favour shining gold, silver, and bronze accented by bright blues, reds, greens, and yellows in intricate patterns. Where there is a large metalic surface, it tends to be curved and burnished to perfection. Where they take on animal aspects they draw from those which are similarly heavily patterned or feature bright flares of plumage or furs.

Having surpassed the limitations of form imposed upon them by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]], the one [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|Immortal]], [[Heratrexisykeari]], is not limited to a single form; she favours the appearance of peackocks and peahens, sometimes disguising herself as mundanely as that, other times taking the form of a humanoid woman in extravagant clothing, and even occasionally assuming the form of a [[creation:true_creation:charon#Yamaraj]] in jest, but with the visage of a peacock rather than a crow. Her servants too were freely shaped by her desires.

===== Immortals ======
There is only one Charis [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortal]], that being the founder, [[Hera]].

===== Mortals ======
==== Dea ====
The Dea are pseudo-immortals sustained by [[Hera]]'s will, serving directly beneath her, and far more active than [[Hera]] herself. Their forms and personalities are all distinct, though they all allied.

===== Eidolons =====
While distinct from the other castes of Charis, Eidolons created from the stuff of [[planes:celestial]] are often employed in as messengers, warriors, or war-beasts in times of need.
