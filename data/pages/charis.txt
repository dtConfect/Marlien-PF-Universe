====== Charis ======
Charis are an offshoot of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] in the [[creation:creation]] [[creation:Marlien]], founded by [[Hera]], an ex-[[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortals|Immortal]]. Unlike the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], who may generally be considered [[alignment:True Neutral]] or [[alignment:Lawful Neutral]], the Charis are generally [[alignment:Neutral Good]]. Though their interference in [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] affairs is infrequent, they are generally more direct, and always less secretive than the [[creation:true_creation:Charon]].

The Charis reside in [[planes:celestial]] and have a strong affinity with [[creation:Marlien:Energy#Positive|Positive Energy]].

===== Origin =====
The Charis were founded by [[Hera]] when she laid claim to the [[:Ubrik Pearl]], an artifact left behind by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]] themselves, perhaps for this precise purposed. The pearl relieves its bearer - even a [[creation:true_creation:Charon]] - of any bonds of form imposed upon itself and its creations by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]], and so [[Hera]] was able to easily distinguish both herself and her subordinates from their peers.

===== Appearance =====
[[Hera]] and her servants exalt an aesthetic of intricacy and extravagance in all but their names, eschewing the complex naming conventions of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] along with the grim appearance imposed upon them by the [[creation:Marlien:Dead Gods]].

Their forms are much-varied and glamorous, drawing influence from all manner of creatures and art forms, mundane and magical. They favour shining gold, silver, and bronze accented by bright blues, reds, greens, and yellows in intricate patterns. Where they take on animal aspects they draw from those which are similarly heavily patterned or feature bright flares of plumage or furs. Where there is a large metalic surface, it tends to be curved and burnished to perfection.

===== Immortals ======
There is only one Charis [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortal]] - that being the founder, [[Hera]]. Once, she shared the power of the [[:Ubrik Pearl]] with another [[creation:true_creation:charon]], [[Pasithea]], who likewise changed his form and shared in her early work, but was driven to madness by his new-found freedom of expression and was ultimately banished. [[Pasithea]] and his minions are now classified among the [[Wild Charis]].

===== Mortals ======
==== Dea ====
The Dea are pseudo-immortals sustained by [[Hera]]'s will, serving directly beneath her, and more active than [[Hera]] herself. As  though they are all allied in their general benevolence. The freedom with which they wield [[Hera]]'s power has lead them, historically, to be viewed as deities by many cultures and individuals, though by the [[year_zero]] they are little known and largely inactive.

  * [[Kepari]]
  * [[Brisbon]]

===== Eidolons =====
The celestial Eidolons conjured by the Charis are aspects of the [[Celestial Titan]] which slumbers in [[planes:celestial]]. They are often employed as messengers or bodyguards by the Charis, or used to bolster their small numbers as warriors or war-beasts in times of need.

====== Charis in Other Cultures ======
==== Xienonxionin ====
Due to her earlier exploits, [[:Hera]] is a significant figure in ancient [[:Xiexio]] [[xiexio:mythology#charis|mythology]], where she is named //Lonwendo//. Her aesthetic is prominent in many modern traditions of art and fashion. Her [[:charis#Dea]] and other subordinates are less well known there, and have generally steered clear since the fall of [[:pasithea]].
