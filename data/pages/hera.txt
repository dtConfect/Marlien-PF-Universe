====== Hera ======
Hera is the self-given name of the ex-[[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortal]] Heratrexisykeari, who presides over the [[Charis]].


===== Origin =====
Originally one of the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#immortal]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#yamaraj| Charon Yamaraj]], a [[creation:true_creation:soul_steward]] who joined [[creation:Marlien]] from the [[creation:true_creation:beyond]] to ensure the wellbeing of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], Heratrexisykeari was a figure of significant power even amongst the other [[creation:true_creation:charon#yamaraj]], with whom she reigned over the [[creation:true_creation:charon]] for the lifetimes of many [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]]s. Still, she was unable to break the bonds of physical form palced upon her kind by the {creation:Marlien:dead_gods]] until after her aquisition of the [[:ubrik_pearl]], an ancient artefact of great power.

By wielding the power of the [[:Ubrik_Pearl]] Hera is able to alter her form freely, as well as that of her servants. This new-found freedom lead to a shift in her outlook; Hera's  efforts to ensure the well being of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]] [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] have since been far more direct than those of the [[creation:true_creation:charon]], though she acts now primarily through her [[:charis#dea]].


===== Appearance =====
Although as a [[creation:true_creation:Charon#Immortal|Charon Immortal]] Hera would ordinarily be bound to the shape of a  [[creation:true_creation:charon#Yamaraj]], the [[Ubrik Pearl]] allows her to freely alter her form. The general aesthetic of the [[Charis]] follows her own ostentatious preference, though Hera herself has a predilection towards shades of blue, green, and bronze.

When spying on mortal affairs or appearing as an omen, Hera usually chooses the form of a peacock or peahen; likewise, the plumage of her [[creation:true_creation:charon#Yamaraj]] form, the vestments of her humanoid forms mimic the patterns of a peacock.

===== Nature =====
Hera rarely uses her power to directly influence mortal affairs, preferring to sustain an order of pseudo-immortal [[Charis]], while herself merely observing from the outer [[planes:planes]], or disguised as some simple creature.
