====== Kepari ======
Kepari the Guardian is a [[Charis#Dea]] of the [[Charis]], and a prominent religious figure in the traditions of [[:Ancient Angdyne]]. Kepari is perhaps the [[Charis]] bearing most in common with the [[creation:true_creation:Charon]], excepting [[:Hera]]'s innate relation; he is a stern and stoic guardian figure, most concerned with the protection of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]], rather than their enrichment, or anything else. Oftentimes, Kepari lends his share of [[:Hera]]'s power to [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal]]s seeking to safeguard settlements, powerful artifacts, or places where great evils are sealed away.

Kepari is often represented by a stag beetle, scarab, or some other form of hard-shelled or horned creature.
