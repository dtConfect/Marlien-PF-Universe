====== Wild Charis ======
The Wild Charis are the ex-[[creation:true_creation:charon]] [[creation:true_creation:charon#Immortal]] [[:pasithea]] and the [[:charis]] aligned to him. They include a number of castes, including pseudo-immortals akin to the [[:charis#dea]], sustained by [[:pasithea]]'s will, instead of [[:Hera]]'s.

===== Immortals =====
The only WIld Charis [[creation:true_creation:charon#immortal]] [[:Pasithea]].

===== Mortals =====
==== Dea ====
Like the [[:charis]] [[:charis#dea]], [[:pasithea]]'s direct subordinates are sustained by his will, and act as conduits for his power. Since [[:Pasithea]] is imprisoned he acts almost entirely through his Dea, though his transmission of power is limited.

===== Eidolons =====
Since [[:pasithea]] and his minions are banished from [[planes:celestial]], they cannot draw upon the power of the [[:celestial_titan]] to form Eidolons, and so their forces are supremely limited.

===== Wild Charis in Other Cultures =====
==== Xienonxionin ====
As with [[:Hera]], [[:Pasithea]]  is a significant figure in ancient [[:Xiexio]] [[xiexio:mythology#charis|mythology]], where he named //Kuenhai//, and is seen not as a great evil, but rather as a powerful and creative entity so seduced by his own passion that he was blind to the devastation his endeavours caused to lesser beings.

==== Fey ====
[[:Pasithea]] and the other wild charis took a great interest in early-mid [[planes:feywild|Feywild]] development, are in part responsible for some of the stranger aspects of that plane, and are still remembered keenly there.
