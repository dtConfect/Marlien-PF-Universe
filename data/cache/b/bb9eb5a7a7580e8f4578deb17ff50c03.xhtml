Kepari the Guardian is a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=charis#dea" class="wikilink1" title="charis">Dea</a> of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=charis" class="wikilink1" title="charis">Charis</a>, and a prominent religious figure in the traditions of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=ancient_angdyne" class="wikilink2" title="ancient_angdyne" rel="nofollow">Ancient Angdyne</a>. Kepari is perhaps the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=charis" class="wikilink1" title="charis">Charis</a> bearing most in common with the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:true_creation:charon" class="wikilink1" title="creation:true_creation:charon">Charon</a>, excepting <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=hera" class="wikilink1" title="hera">Hera</a>&#039;s innate relation; he is a stern and stoic guardian figure, most concerned with the protection of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman" class="wikilink1" title="creation:true_creation:primordial_elements">atman</a>, rather than their enrichment, or anything else. Oftentimes, Kepari lends his share of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=hera" class="wikilink1" title="hera">Hera</a>&#039;s power to <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mortal" class="wikilink1" title="creation:true_creation:primordial_elements">mortal</a>s seeking to safeguard settlements, powerful artifacts, or places where great evils are sealed away.

Kepari is often represented by a stag beetle, scarab, or some other form of hard-shelled or horned creature. His actual form is that of a chitin-clad humanoid with patterned lace wings folded beneath a burnished shell of dark bronze, dressed in an ornate tabard and, and with gleaming white fur erupting from the seams of his shell. Kepari&#039;s shell is self-grown rather than manufactured, since he drank deeply from the power of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=celestial_titan" class="wikilink2" title="celestial_titan" rel="nofollow">Celestial Titan</a> and entered into a cocoon for a long while. Judging from the unusual shape shape of his limbs and head, it is unlikely that there is much resembling a human remaining beneath his shell.
