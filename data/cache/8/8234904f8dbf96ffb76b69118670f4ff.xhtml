<p>
Vangrund was one of the nations emerging from the collapse of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=arthalean_empire" class="wikilink1" title="arthalean_empire">The Arthaelean Empire</a> - a kingdom based around the land to the south-east of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=paraesi:north_sea" class="wikilink1" title="paraesi:north_sea">The North Sea</a> of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=paraesi" class="wikilink1" title="paraesi">Paraesi</a>. It was founded when the church of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=religion:solenist_academia" class="wikilink2" title="religion:solenist_academia" rel="nofollow">Solenist Academia</a> presented to the public the boy who would become the first king of Vangrund, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=rinus_sangey" class="wikilink2" title="rinus_sangey" rel="nofollow">Rinus Sangey</a>, who they proclaimed to be of the same blood as the Emperors, and the nearest they would find to the rightful heir to the throne. By all accounts young <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=rinus_sangey" class="wikilink2" title="rinus_sangey" rel="nofollow">Rinus Sangey</a> was charismatic, and held a certain religious significance in coming from the Solenist monasteries, where he was kept chaste and groomed for induction into the faith.
