They are approximately 50% taller than <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=human" class="wikilink2" title="human" rel="nofollow">Human</a>s, slight, and pale-skinned, resembling the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=elfin" class="wikilink2" title="elfin" rel="nofollow">Elfin</a> to whom they are related.

Svailorn cities are as mighty and glorious as those of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=elfin" class="wikilink2" title="elfin" rel="nofollow">Elfin</a> in <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=planes:feywild" class="wikilink1" title="planes:feywild">The Feywild</a>. No attention to detail is spared, and vast quantities of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=moon_dust" class="wikilink2" title="moon_dust" rel="nofollow">moon_dust</a> and fine fabrics are gathered together to maintain their aesthetic. Even Svailorn dwelling in jungles and forests ensure that though their settlements may be difficult to find, they will inspire awe upon arrival: they are towering, layered castles of intricately carved and woven wood, draped in animal skins and fabrics as fine as those made in the cities, lit by innumerable lanterns shaded by coloured papers.

<a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=star" class="wikilink2" title="star" rel="nofollow">Star</a>s hold a great significance in Svailorn culture, being only visible from certain parts of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=lufia" class="wikilink1" title="lufia">Lufia</a>, and only under certain circumstances. In the settlements about <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=lufia:the_moonsea" class="wikilink2" title="lufia:the_moonsea" rel="nofollow">The Moonsea</a> grand festivals are held at times when the skies ordinarily clear about the southside, revealing the stars, white reflect clearly in the waters. In the jungle or forest territories towering observatories are constructed to reach above the canopies, where the stars might be glimpsed. From the borders of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=lufia:white_desert" class="wikilink2" title="lufia:white_desert" rel="nofollow">White Desert</a>, sometimes pilgrimages are made to its inner reaches, where the stars are always visible at night. Some of the &#039;monuments&#039; there, formed of meteors surviving their impacts into the soft sand, are revered as fallen stars.
