In many cases inter-<a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spire" class="wikilink1" title="spire">Spire</a> travel requires that a vehicle moves between two or more dominant gravitational fields, such as that of a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spire" class="wikilink1" title="spire">Spire</a> and that of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:marlien" class="wikilink1" title="creation:marlien">Marlien</a>&#039;s main terrain. In such situations, it is important to properly orientate the vehicle to avoid capsizing, or other sudden movements and unstable behaviors.
</p>

<p>
In the most straightforward case, where the vehicle is moving out of the atmosphere of a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spire" class="wikilink1" title="spire">Spire</a>, and into the atmosphere of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:marlien" class="wikilink1" title="creation:marlien">Marlien</a>&#039;s terrain, the vehicle should ideally be facing northward, moving northward and upward, and the aft of the vehicle weighed below the bow; this should keep the vehicle in an upright orientation and maintain velocity.
</p>

<p>
In the reverse case, the vehicle should be facing the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spire" class="wikilink1" title="spire">Spire</a>, moving toward the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spire" class="wikilink1" title="spire">Spire</a>, and the aft of the vehicle again weighed below the bow; this should keep the vehicle in an upright orientation and maintain velocity.
