a:6:{s:2:"id";s:39:"creation:true_creation:soul_destruction";s:6:"prefix";s:0:"";s:4:"text";s:1582:"====== Soul Destruction ======
Soul Destruction refers to the destruction of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] by force of [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana|will]], consumption by [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]], [[#digestion]] in a [[soul gigerium]] or [[soul cauldron]], or by other means.

===== Consumption =====
A [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]] leaches [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] from another [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] without damaging the [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment|enrichment]] of the victim, though such a victim may still be destroyed if it does not produce [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] more quickly than the parasite takes it. Such a destruction is refered to as consumption.

===== Digestion =====
[[soul gigerium]] and [[soul cauldron]]s are two physical constructions which function in a very similar way, leaching mana from an [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] similarly to a [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#hunger]], and feeding it into some receptacle - often another [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]]. While digestion in this manner harms the [[creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment|enrichment]] of the [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#atman]] digested, eventually depriving it of its ability to produce enough [[creation:true_creation:primordial_elements#mana]] to sustain itself, it does not serve to enrich the receptacle.";s:6:"suffix";s:0:"";s:4:"date";i:0;s:6:"client";s:9:"dtconfect";}
