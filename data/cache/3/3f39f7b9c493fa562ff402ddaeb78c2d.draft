Generally speaking, those used nearest to their invention were the most physically destructive and magically contaminating, with later bombs designed either to destroy a limited area or populace, while leaving any desirable assets or territories nearby uncontaminated. This advancement was largely owed to a design which captured the energy of a soul bomb and channeled it inward, into a [[:mana_crystal]], containing arcane corruption and reducing the chance of a chain reaction.

Because of this, the remains of [[:Darohl]] most highly corrupted and dangerous at the [[:year_zero]] are those near the center, where the earliest, most destructive weapons were intended to cause the most damage and terror as possible. The innermost holds of [[:Darohl]] remain intact, though monsters descended from the events outside now roam those forgotten halls.
