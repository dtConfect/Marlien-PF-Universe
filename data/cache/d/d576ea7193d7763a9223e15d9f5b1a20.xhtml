The Arcane Holocaust was the conflict between the ancient civilisations of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=graadien" class="wikilink1" title="graadien">Graadien</a> and <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=darohl" class="wikilink1" title="darohl">Darohl</a> culminating in the development and deployment of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=soul_bomb" class="wikilink1" title="soul_bomb">Soul Bomb</a> against <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=darohl" class="wikilink1" title="darohl">Darohl</a>, and subsequent <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=graadien#sacking" class="wikilink1" title="graadien">sacking</a> of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=graadien" class="wikilink1" title="graadien">Graadien</a> by the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:true_creation:charon" class="wikilink1" title="creation:true_creation:charon">Charon</a>.

<p>
<a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=soul_bomb" class="wikilink1" title="soul_bomb">Soul Bomb</a>s were used in the holocaust from the moment of their invention, and each one differed as <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=graadien" class="wikilink1" title="graadien">Graadien</a> mages experimented with different techniques. Generally speaking, those used nearest to their invention were the most physically destructive and magically contaminating, with later bombs designed either to destroy a limited area or populace, while leaving any desirable assets or territories nearby uncontaminated. This advancement was largely owed to a design which captured the energy of a soul bomb and channeled it inward, into a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=mana_crystal" class="wikilink2" title="mana_crystal" rel="nofollow">mana_crystal</a>, containing arcane corruption and reducing the chance of a chain reaction.

<p>
Because of this, the remains of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=darohl" class="wikilink1" title="darohl">Darohl</a> most highly corrupted and dangerous at the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=year_zero" class="wikilink2" title="year_zero" rel="nofollow">year_zero</a> are those near the center, where the earliest, most destructive weapons were intended to cause the most damage and terror as possible. The innermost holds of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=darohl" class="wikilink1" title="darohl">Darohl</a> remain intact, though monsters descended from the events outside now roam those forgotten halls. The outskirts of the city are mostly intact - in part due to efforts to fortify and seal off the place by the last stragglers of its dying populace - with architecture still standing strong where the later soul bombs were detonated; they are, like the inner holds, patrolled by manifold horrors, but brave adventurers sometimes venture near for the promise of valuable <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=mana_crystals" class="wikilink2" title="mana_crystals" rel="nofollow">mana_crystals</a> that might be found there.
