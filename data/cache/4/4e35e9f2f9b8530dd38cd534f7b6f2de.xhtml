<p>
The Daemon Knights of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=nustalem" class="wikilink2" title="nustalem" rel="nofollow">Nustalem</a> are a small unit of heavily-armoured warriors serving <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=prince_of_pain" class="wikilink1" title="prince_of_pain">Ligeron</a>. They are <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=kyton#fleshbound" class="wikilink2" title="kyton" rel="nofollow">fleshbound Kytons</a> of varying strengths, each posessing the body of a willing host, whose soul remains tied to the vessel also, enduring constant agony. The knights take great pleasure in modifying their host bodies to their liking, often altering them so as to cause constant pain, or to heighten sensations; in every case the internal organs have been replaced with <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=shadowstuff" class="wikilink2" title="shadowstuff" rel="nofollow">shadowstuff</a>, so the princes cannot be killed by traditional means.
