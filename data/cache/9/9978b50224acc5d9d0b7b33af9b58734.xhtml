Xiexio (she-shö) is the abbreviated name of the Xienonxionin (She-non-shö-nin), also named Xeno or Zeno by the phonetic translation of their hieroglyphs by some <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=naltera" class="wikilink1" title="naltera">Naltera</a> scholars.
The Xienonxionin are a race of technologically advanced, four-armed humanoids uniquely native to <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a>.

Whether by natural evolution, the product of genetic manipulation, or a deliberate mutation influenced by some outsider, Xienonxionin and some other creatures native to <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a> posses the innate ability to manipulate kinesis-sensitive materials such as <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> via telekinesis. As a result, many Xiexio technologies, tools, vehicles, etc. accommodate hands-free operation by integration of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a>. It is cheap enough on <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a> to add sufficient quantities of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> to most small tools and arms, to produce jewelery and even clothing laced with the material. Many of the smaller <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=xiexio:vehicles" class="wikilink1" title="xiexio:vehicles">xiexio vehicles</a>, including one-man <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spacecraft" class="wikilink1" title="spacecraft">Spacecraft</a> are built using sufficient quantities of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> to allow telekinetic rearrangement of modules, and even piloting, though the Xiexio prefer to build a projected, haptic interface into important machines in case of circumstances which interfere with the use of telekinesis.
</p>

<p>
Typically military vehicles, weapons and arms designed for use around hostile Xienonxionin do not utilise Jinxi, as it leaves such tools open to outside influence. Modular personal <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spacecraft" class="wikilink1" title="spacecraft">Spacecraft</a> which rely heavily on <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> manipulation usually include a system of tethers which can be manually locked in place from the cockpit, preventing external sabotage.

<h2 class="sectionedit4" id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Xienonxionin are of roughly human stature and build, tending to be shorter on average, and slight or athletic rather than muscular - though their range of builds is as extreme as it may be among humans. The first pair of arms is located where a human&#039;s would be, while the second extend from an additional pair of shoulders just below and behind the first. They have a deep, somewhat dull pink or purple complexion, ranging through to pale blue tones in some regions of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a>. Their hair, typically adorned with <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> beads, is most naturally a purple or blue colour darker than the skin, fading to a silver-gray with age; lighter shades of blue, even almost white, are also found naturally, and teal hair is a somewhat rare occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Facially, Xienonxionin vary from region to region, but to a human of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=naltera" class="wikilink1" title="naltera">Naltera</a>, the notable differences in face shape are a tendency towards narrow noses, large lips, and lobeless ears which are sometimes pointed, and sometimes like small circles. Furthermore, where a human would have eyebrows a Xienonxionin appears to have a row of spherical stones set into the brow; though hard and solid these are actually formed from the same material as the hair, and so share its colour. The number of these stones varies from person to person but is usually between 3 and 5, with the stones nearer to the centre being on average the largest.

<h2 class="sectionedit5" id="culture">Culture</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Xienonxionin culture varies around the globe, but the dominant culture is a heavily class-based, communist meritocracy ruled by a a high council composed of the leaders from all nations of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a>, including those who otherwise distance themselves from the global culture. Personal humility and respect of one&#039;s superiors is a general point of importance, though an individual&#039;s standing is more flexible than in many cultures, being strongly swayed by the current situation - an aristocrat will often bow before his tailor, dressmaker, bodyguard, etc. when he is pleased with their work, or has an awkward request. As a result, interactions between Xienonxionin may appear erratic to other races, with each participant fluctuating between different levels of respectfulness and flippancy. This is worsenned by the fact that other races typically only deal with <a href="#council" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">council officials</a> and <a href="#spacers" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">spacers</a>, whose close standing, differing roles, and exposure to other cultures often makes for a lack of social precedent.
</p>

<p>
In most Xienonxionin cultures individuals of high standing wear loose-fitting robes with no specific sleeves cut and paint their faces with heavy make-up in traditional styles. Robes and other garments, as with hair, are often laced with <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=jinxi" class="wikilink1" title="jinxi">Jinxi</a> to allow for telekinetic control. Those in active occupations, such as <a href="#spacers" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">spacers</a>, often wear tighter-fitting garments. Lower classes of Xiexio, or those in roles requiring physical activity, often cut their hair short, while others tie it into ornate knots with the aid of their telekinesis. Messy or free-flowing hair may be seen as a sign of stupidity, laziness, lack of pride, or disregard for others.

<p>
Xienonxionin do not make a habit of journeying off world, but those who do are usually <a href="#spacers" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">spacers</a>. Their society upon <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=thexingja" class="wikilink1" title="thexingja">Thexingja</a> is advanced enough that true adventuring is not common amongst the inner cities; open spaces are easily surveyed with the aid of long-range vehicles, so only the deepest jungles and most imposing terrain on the fringes of civilization remain to be explored.

<h2 class="sectionedit7" id="spacers">Spacers</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
A much varied profession captured under one title; Spacers operate under the authority of the Spacers&#039; Guild, which although technically beneath the <a href="#council" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">council</a> operates independently of it, and could easily oppose it in military might. Open conflict or espionage, however, is in the interests of neither party.
</p>

<p>
Agents of the Spacers&#039; Guild include merchants traveling to what few distant places the Xienonxionin openly trade with, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=xiexio:pioneers" class="wikilink2" title="xiexio:pioneers" rel="nofollow">Pioneers</a> who explore the far reaches of space to gather information for scientific and navigational purposes, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=xiexio:shepherds" class="wikilink2" title="xiexio:shepherds" rel="nofollow">Shepherds</a> who police trade routes and space within the Xiexio territories, and Sheriffs or Special Agents, who travel throughout Xiexio space and distant places, usually alone or in pairs, to pursue the interests of the <a href="#council" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">Council</a> or Spacer&#039;s Guild in the name of peace-keeping.
</p>

<p>
The hierarchy of the Spacer&#039;s Guild is complex, with the lowest ranks being mercenary and ill-defined in role, but a clear upper echelon and system of promotion beyond that. Almost anyone can get a Spacer&#039;s license and begin to operate as a mercenary Spacer, but they are similarly easily dismissed at such a low rank.
</p>

<p>
At higher ranks individuals will begin to see the gears of guild politics in motion as their orders from their superiors begin to conflict with those of the council. Even a high-ranking Sheriff is duty-bound to follow the orders of the lowliest <a href="#council" title="xiexio ↵" class="wikilink1">Council</a> official, though that official must lean on the support of his superiors if the guild as an entity questions those orders. In most cases this level of politicking is taken care of by the guild directors and high counselors themselves, or a dissenting member of either organisation will clearly hold no sway over an agent&#039;s actions, but on occasion, a guild agent recieving opposing orders will be left in the lurch, having to muster what support they can to do what they believe is right.

Such practitioners have a high standing in Xiexio society, since their technology in <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:marlien" class="wikilink1" title="creation:marlien">Marlien</a> is based upon arcane principles, and their batteries charged with magical energy.

<p>
Production teams for Xiexio computer technology, advanced mechanics, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=spacecraft" class="wikilink1" title="spacecraft">Spacecraft</a>, weapons systems, and so on, are a mix of pure technicians, who are often more the more skilled, and mage technicians, who are necessary for advanced technologies. Technologies are designed specifically to be safe and usable by anyone, regardless of magical ability.
</p>

<p>
Few Xiexio work as dedicated battery chargers as they once might have in small villages, because there are limits to even the most talented channeller&#039;s daily potential. For larger communities <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=xiexio:ritual_plant" class="wikilink2" title="xiexio:ritual_plant" rel="nofollow">Ritual Plant</a>s are usually set up with an infrastructure which provides energy to all surrounding buildings and sites; once activated by a group of Mage Technicians, such a site requires only one or two to monitor and maintain it over its lifespan.
