<p>
The First North Sea Fiend Storm was the first major <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=fiend_storm" class="wikilink1" title="fiend_storm">Fiend Storm</a> in the recorded history of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=paraesi" class="wikilink1" title="paraesi">Paraesi</a>. It was caused, and possibly also terminated, by the works of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">Godmage Vinewyltt</a>.

<p>
The storm was responsible for the immediate decimation of the surrounding <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a>, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=warelin" class="wikilink1" title="warelin">Warelin</a>, and <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=emerowydthwaeth" class="wikilink1" title="emerowydthwaeth">Emerowydthwaeth</a> peoples, including the lone <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=emerowydthwaeth" class="wikilink1" title="emerowydthwaeth">Emerowydthwaeth</a> city <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=emero_wydth" class="wikilink1" title="emero_wydth">Emero Wydth</a>. The fallout of the storm corrupted surrounding creatures, including many of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">Godmage Vinewyltt</a>&#039;s <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=chimera" class="wikilink1" title="chimera">Chimera</a>s, and rendered the mountains incredibly hazardous for centuries to come.
</p>

<p>
For the duration of the event the majority of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a> was unscathed, though the eye of the storm did not extend so far as the citadel&#039;s outermost walls on any side other than that from which <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">Godmage Vinewyltt</a>&#039;s <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt_s_keep" class="wikilink2" title="vinewyltt_s_keep" rel="nofollow">Vinewyltt&#039;s Keep</a> overlooked the valley. The people trapped within were coralled to the very top and centre, at the foot of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt_s_keep" class="wikilink2" title="vinewyltt_s_keep" rel="nofollow">Vinewyltt&#039;s Keep</a>, whereafter the eldritch creatures and powers emerging from the outskirts closed in ever tighter, and many of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a> people were slain, or worse.
</p>

<p>
At the termination of the storm, when <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">Godmage Vinewyltt</a> emerged from the valley after <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt#transformation" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">transformation</a>, the survivors of the catastrophe were freed to flee the citadel, <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=vinewyltt" class="wikilink1" title="vinewyltt">Godmage Vinewyltt</a> having slain a number of the most prominent creatures threatening his people before ascending to the eye. Still, few of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a> people were able to escape alive, and fewer still made it through the outside desolation to met up with the fleeing <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=warelin" class="wikilink1" title="warelin">Warelin</a> people.
