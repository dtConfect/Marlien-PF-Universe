Antheraea, the Golden Lady, the Moth Empress, is a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=charis#dea" class="wikilink1" title="charis">Dea</a> of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=charis" class="wikilink1" title="charis">Charis</a>. She rarely visits physically, preferring to hold congress in dreams and visions, where she appears as a giant woman with rosy skin, golden garments, and an enormous set of yellow moth&#039;s wings. In reality she is of no such great stature, though certainly larger than a <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=human" class="wikilink2" title="human" rel="nofollow">human</a> and possessed of wings and antennae like that of a moth. She wears a light suit of golden chitinous armour and a long, fabric skirt and a full helmet somewhat resembling the head and crest of a peacock. She favours throwing knives if she must fight, but also wields powerful magics of illusion.

<p>
Her chief concerns are fortune, charity, and <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment" class="wikilink1" title="creation:true_creation:soul_enrichment">Soul Enrichment</a>.
