Vinewyltt was the founder and absolute ruler of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a> for the entire duration of its existance. He was an unrivalled practitioner of the <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=creation:magic#arcane" class="wikilink1" title="creation:magic">arcane</a> arts, a virtually-immortal human, creator of various <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=chimera" class="wikilink1" title="chimera">Chimera</a>, and considered a deity by his <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=uubvine" class="wikilink1" title="uubvine">Uubvine</a> subjects.

One of Vinewyltt&#039;s favoured pastimes and avenues of research was in the keeping of exotic creatures, bending them to his will, and experimentation in creating new species. Through his experiments he created countless unique creatures, some breeds of which far outlasted their creator:
