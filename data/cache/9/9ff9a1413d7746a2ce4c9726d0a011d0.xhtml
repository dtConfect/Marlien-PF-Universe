The Fire Plane is the home of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=tingma" class="wikilink2" title="tingma" rel="nofollow">Tingma</a>, created by herself to seal her destructive power away from the other <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=planes:planes" class="wikilink1" title="planes:planes">Planes</a>. Being a schism of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=planes:material" class="wikilink1" title="planes:material">The Material Plane</a>, it is not entirely composed of fire, though the number of other substances which can retain a solid or even liquid state near to the intense heat of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=tingma" class="wikilink2" title="tingma" rel="nofollow">Tingma</a> is few, and many of the inhabitants, which include fire elementals, are composed at least in part of living fire or magma.

<p>
The terrain is composed of splintered rock and magma flows, falling away from a central peak where the throne of <a href="/naltera/doku.php?id=tingma" class="wikilink2" title="tingma" rel="nofollow">Tingma</a> sits.
